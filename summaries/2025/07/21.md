# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

The log shows a single code file, `B_Vika_and_the_Bridge.cpp`, updated on July 20, 2025, at 11:35:06 PM.  The code is a C++ program that appears to be designed for competitive programming.  It includes numerous commented-out sections containing functions for calculating factorials, powers, modular inverses, and combinations (nCr), along with commented-out code for Sieve of Eratosthenes (for finding prime numbers) and calculating the number of divisors for each number up to N (1e6 + 10).  The `CutiePie()` function is declared but its body is empty. The `main` function reads an integer `qt` and then calls `CutiePie()` `qt` times.  The main body of the program is largely placeholder with most computation logic commented out.  The commented code suggests the program was initially designed to handle more complex mathematical operations, but currently its functionality is minimal.
