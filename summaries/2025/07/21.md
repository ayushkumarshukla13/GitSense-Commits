# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 12:33:18 AM
The log shows a single code file, `B_Vika_and_the_Bridge.cpp`, updated on July 20, 2025, at 11:35:06 PM.  The code is a C++ program that appears to be designed for competitive programming.  It includes numerous commented-out sections containing functions for calculating factorials, powers, modular inverses, and combinations (nCr), along with commented-out code for Sieve of Eratosthenes (for finding prime numbers) and calculating the number of divisors for each number up to N (1e6 + 10).  The `CutiePie()` function is declared but its body is empty. The `main` function reads an integer `qt` and then calls `CutiePie()` `qt` times.  The main body of the program is largely placeholder with most computation logic commented out.  The commented code suggests the program was initially designed to handle more complex mathematical operations, but currently its functionality is minimal.


## 9:46:43 AM
The log shows a single file, `B_Vika_and_the_Bridge.cpp`, undergoing numerous modifications between 8:47 AM and 9:45 AM on July 21, 2025.  The initial code contained a `CutiePie` function that was incomplete, only reading input into a vector `v`.  Subsequent changes focused on completing this function:

* **8:47:25 AM:** The `push_back` function is correctly used to add elements to `v`.
* **8:48 AM - 8:52 AM:** Several incomplete attempts to use a second vector, initially `v` again, and then a 2D vector `ve`, are made.  These changes reflect the programmer experimenting with data structures.
* **8:52:29 AM:**  The 2D vector `ve` is correctly initialized and used to store indices based on the values in vector `v`. This is a key step toward solving the problem.
* **8:52:48 AM - 9:45:36 AM:** The focus shifts to calculating a maximum value (`ans`). The process involves iterative refinements: initially attempting to find a minimum value, then experimenting with nested loops and then calculating differences between consecutive elements within the inner vectors of `ve`. Eventually, it employs `max_element` to find the maximum difference and refines the logic using `sort` and `reverse` for efficiency.  The final version calculates a sum (`sum`) based on the maximum differences.
The commented-out code suggests the programmer considered using sieve methods for prime numbers and divisor calculations, but these were ultimately unused in the final version of the code.  The numerous edits between 8:48 AM and 9:45 AM strongly suggest a period of debugging and algorithm refinement.
