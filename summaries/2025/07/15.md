# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 7:59:29 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program (`E_Mirror_Grid.cpp`) between 2:00 PM and 2:04 PM on July 15, 2025.  The core functionality involves processing a square grid represented by a 2D character vector.

The initial versions (2:00:14 PM and 2:00:19 PM) contain commented-out code suggesting exploration of sieve methods (likely for prime number generation) and divisor calculation functions.  These were ultimately not used in the final solution.

Between 2:00:19 PM and 2:01:18 PM, the program's core logic started being developed within the `CutiePie` function.  This involved reading in an integer `n` representing grid size and initializing a `vector<vector<char>>` called `mat`.  The code was incrementally built to read input characters into the matrix.

The period from 2:01:18 PM to 2:04:36 PM shows the main algorithm being implemented within the nested loops in `CutiePie`. The algorithm iterates through each cell of the input square grid. For each cell, it counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the cell and its mirror image cells across the grid's diagonals. Based on the count of '0' and '1', it updates a variable `ans` and modifies the characters of the corresponding cells in `mat`.  The final version (2:04:36 PM) prints the final value of `ans`.  The commented-out sieve and divisor code remains.
