# Activity Summary for 7/12/2025

## 11:28:41 AM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program, `B_Stone_Age_Problem.cpp`,  between 10:32 AM and 10:52 AM on July 12, 2025.  The code primarily focuses on solving a problem involving a vector of pairs and handling queries.

Initially, the `CutiePie` function was incomplete.  Over several edits (10:32:42 AM to 10:33:18 AM), it was progressively fleshed out to read inputs `n` and `q`, and declare a vector.  Further modifications (10:33:46 AM - 10:38:03 AM) involved adding a `vector<pair<int,int>> vp` to store pairs, reading input `x` into the vector and then finally adding it correctly to the vector using `push_back`. A `pair<int,int> g` is also introduced and initialized.  The purpose of the pairs seems to be tracking values and their associated query numbers.


Significant changes occurred in the `CutiePie` function between 10:35:08 AM and 10:50:51 AM, where the logic for handling queries was implemented.  The code iterates through queries (`for(int i=1;i<=q;i++)`). It checks a query type (`if(x==1)`).  If the query type is 1, it updates a specific element in `vp` and updates a running sum (`sum`) based on the change, considering a global maximum using `g`.  Otherwise (query type is not 1), it updates the global values in `g` and recalculates the sum.

The final version (10:50:51 AM - 10:52:30 AM) adds `cout<<sum<<endl;` to output the sum at the end of each query processing in `CutiePie`. The `main` function originally read the number of test cases but finally the `cin >> qt;` line is commented out so that only 1 test case is being considered.  The commented-out sections of the code suggest the exploration of functionalities like sieving for prime numbers and calculating the number of divisors. These features were ultimately not incorporated into the final program.
