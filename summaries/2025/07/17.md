# Activity Summary for 7/17/2025

## 9:00:51 PM
The log shows development on four C++ files within the `Cp_ALGO` directory.  A common theme across multiple files is the inclusion of commented-out code related to sieve methods, calculating divisors, and various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr). This suggests the programmer may be experimenting with different approaches or reusing code snippets across problems.  All files also use a `CutiePie` function as the main function body, indicating a possible naming convention or a template structure for solving problems.

**File: `E_Mirror_Grid.cpp`**

*   Only one entry exists for this file, at 7/17/2025, 8:05:31 PM.  No code is provided, so no further details on this file can be given.


**File: `A_Only_One_Digit.cpp`**

*   Multiple revisions occurred between 7/17/2025, 8:06:19 PM and 7/17/2025, 8:06:57 PM.
*   The main change involves the implementation of the `CutiePie` function.  Initially, it was empty; then it was improved to find the minimum digit in a given integer.  The final version correctly outputs this minimum digit.


**File: `B_No_Casino_in_the_Mountains.cpp`**

*   The file was modified several times between 7/17/2025, 8:08:51 PM and 7/17/2025, 8:12:51 PM.
*   The `CutiePie` function was fleshed out to solve a problem involving hiking days and rest days based on input.
*   Initial versions contained errors in variable usage (`a` was used without declaration), input reading, and the `bool` variable assignment.
*   The final version correctly reads input into a vector `v`, utilizes the vector correctly for the algorithm, and outputs the result with proper `endl`.


**File: `C_I_Will_Definitely_Make_It.cpp`**

*   This file underwent the most extensive modifications, with revisions between 7/17/2025, 8:26:52 PM and 7/17/2025, 8:54:03 PM.
*   The `CutiePie` function's evolution shows an attempt to solve a more complex problem likely involving determining if a condition is met within a given array, based on a specified index `k`.
*   There were several attempts, including finding the maximum value in the array and checking time differences.
*   The final correct version involves sorting the input vector, defining a `cur` value based on `k`, and checking if the difference between subsequent elements after the kth element is greater than the value at k-1.  Incorrect logic and syntax errors were corrected in various revisions before arriving at this solution.  The use of a `set` to remove duplicate elements also appears in this process.

The overall pattern shows iterative problem-solving within each file, with debugging and refinement based on intermediate test runs and error correction.
