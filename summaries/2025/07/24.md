# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 12:49:03 AM
The log shows code development across two files, `More_Cookies.cpp` and `Sugar_Limit.cpp`, between 8:22 PM and 9:22 PM on July 23, 2025.

`More_Cookies.cpp`: This file underwent two minor revisions within a minute (8:22 PM - 8:23 PM). The changes primarily involved correcting a minor logical error in the `CutiePie` function.  The initial version had a flaw in its logic for determining the number of cookies to add, which was subsequently fixed by changing variable names and correctly calculating the value to output.  The core algorithm and structure remained unchanged.


`Sugar_Limit.cpp`: This file shows a significant evolution over a longer period (8:24 PM - 9:22 PM). Initially, the `CutiePie` function was empty.  The code was gradually developed, with the following key stages:

1.  **8:29 PM:** Input for two vectors, `a` and `b`, representing tastiness and sugar levels respectively, was added to `CutiePie`.
2.  **8:31 PM - 8:35 PM:**  Multiple revisions focused on finding the minimum and maximum values within the input vectors and refining the logic for calculating the final answer.  The code included attempts to implement `min` and `max` functions and debugging the logic to handle cases where `a[i]` is less than or equal to zero.
3.  **8:39 PM - 8:40 PM:** The `CutiePie` function was simplified, and further attempts to handle the problem's logic are visible.
4.  **8:41 PM - 8:42 PM:** The logic is completely rewritten to calculate `ans` by iterating through `a` and summing elements with `a[i] > 0`.  This involves subtracting `maxi` (maximum sugar level).  The handling of edge cases where `ans-maxi` might become negative is also introduced.  
5.  **8:43 PM - 8:48 PM:** The solution is significantly restructured and improved. The previous approach of iterating over a range of sugar limits (0-100) is replaced by a more efficient solution that directly calculates the maximum satisfaction based on the input data. The logic for correctly calculating the `maxSatisfaction` variable is finalized.
6.  **8:48 PM - 9:22 PM:** Minor adjustments to variable names, code comments, and input/output handling are made, resulting in a final, polished solution. The use of `LLONG_MIN` for better handling of large inputs is also introduced.  The final version iterates through a range of sugar limits to find the maximum satisfaction.


Throughout the `Sugar_Limit.cpp` edits, there is a persistent presence of commented-out code related to prime number sieves, divisor counts, and modular arithmetic utilities, suggesting the programmer reused a template containing these elements.  The final version of `Sugar_Limit.cpp` removed the commented-out code for modular arithmetic utilities. The final code correctly calculates the maximum satisfaction given a sugar limit.  The comments are consistent throughout and helpful in understanding the code.
