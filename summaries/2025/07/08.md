# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 8:46:22 PM
The log shows edits to the file `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\A_Add_or_XOR.cpp`.  The initial version (5:50:25 PM) contains a basic C++ program structure with commented-out code for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modInverse, and nCr functions.  Between 6:04:41 PM and 6:05:46 PM, the `CutiePie` function underwent significant changes.  It was initially empty, then it was expanded to take input `n`,  read `n` integers into a vector `v`, and then incomplete code appeared trying to assign that to another vector `a`. This was further modified to check if `n` is less than 4 and then outputting -1 if true. The final version (6:05:46 PM and 6:14:29 PM)  includes a complete `CutiePie` function that handles the case where n is less than 4 by printing -1 and otherwise presumably proceeds with further computations (the code is incomplete in this regard). The commented-out code remains unchanged throughout all the edits.  The majority of changes occurred within a short timeframe around 6:04 PM.  The final edits (6:14:19 PM and 6:14:29 PM) did not alter the code.
