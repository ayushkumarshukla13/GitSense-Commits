# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 8:46:22 PM
The log shows edits to the file `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\A_Add_or_XOR.cpp`.  The initial version (5:50:25 PM) contains a basic C++ program structure with commented-out code for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modInverse, and nCr functions.  Between 6:04:41 PM and 6:05:46 PM, the `CutiePie` function underwent significant changes.  It was initially empty, then it was expanded to take input `n`,  read `n` integers into a vector `v`, and then incomplete code appeared trying to assign that to another vector `a`. This was further modified to check if `n` is less than 4 and then outputting -1 if true. The final version (6:05:46 PM and 6:14:29 PM)  includes a complete `CutiePie` function that handles the case where n is less than 4 by printing -1 and otherwise presumably proceeds with further computations (the code is incomplete in this regard). The commented-out code remains unchanged throughout all the edits.  The majority of changes occurred within a short timeframe around 6:04 PM.  The final edits (6:14:19 PM and 6:14:29 PM) did not alter the code.

The log shows the evolution of a C++ code file, `A_Add_or_XOR.cpp`, over a short period (approximately 15 minutes) on July 8, 2025.  The code appears to be solving a problem involving vectors, sets, and possibly some form of two-pointer approach.

Initially, the code included numerous commented-out sections, suggesting a testing or experimentation phase. These commented sections contain functions for sieve of Eratosthenes (prime checking), calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and combinations (nCr). These were seemingly unused in the final version.

The main development focused on the `CutiePie` function.  Early revisions involved incomplete code for vector input and the use of a `set` to store unique elements.  Between 11:18 PM and 11:20 PM, there were several incremental updates.  The  `check` function was added to check for the presence of elements in the set.  The `while` loop within `CutiePie` suggests a two-pointer approach to find a solution, though the core logic within the `while` loop and `check` function underwent many iterations before settling into its final form.

A key change occurred around 11:22 PM when the `check` function was refined to return `true` only if an element was either the smallest or largest element within the set, and the set was updated dynamically, removing used elements within the main logic of the `CutiePie` function.


The final version of the code at 11:23 PM implements a solution that iterates from both ends of the vector, checking if the current element is either the smallest or largest in the set and removing it if so.  If a solution is found (`i < j`), it prints the indices (`i+1` and `j+1`); otherwise, it prints `-1`.  The commented-out code remains throughout all revisions.
