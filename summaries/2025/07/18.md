# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 8:04:49 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program, `D_This_Is_the_Last_Time.cpp`, between 7:21 PM and 7:23 PM on July 18, 2025.  The core functionality involves reading input values `n` and `k`, followed by a vector `v` of size `n`.  The code then focuses on a specific element `v[k-1]` (referred to as `init`).

Initially, the `CutiePie` function was incomplete.  Between 7:21:08 PM and 7:21:16 PM, the input for `k` was added.  Subsequent changes from 7:21:16 PM to 7:21:40 PM involved building the vector `v` by reading `n` integer inputs.  From 7:21:40 PM to 7:22:14 PM, a `set` called `st` was introduced to store elements of `v` that are greater than `init`.  The final changes, from 7:22:14 PM to 7:23:01 PM, introduced a boolean variable `ans` and a loop that checks a condition based on the difference between consecutive elements in `st` compared to `init`.  Finally, the program outputs "YES" or "NO" depending on the value of `ans`.

The commented-out code suggests that the program initially included functionalities for sieving prime numbers and calculating divisors, which were later removed or unused in the final version.  All changes were made within a short period, indicating a focused coding session.
