# Activity Summary for 7/26/2025

## 1:28:00 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`C_Make_Them_Equal.cpp`) over a short period on July 25, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is the `CutiePie()` function. Initially, this function was empty.  The code underwent several iterations, adding input reading (`cin >> n >> c; string s; cin >> s;`),  a loop to find the index `j` of a specific character `c` within string `s`, and conditional logic based on the value of `j` relative to `n/2`.  The final version of `CutiePie()` takes an integer `n` and a character `c` as input, reads a string `s`, and then outputs either 0, 1, or 2 along with potentially two integers, depending on whether the string `s` contains only the character `c` or not and the position of the first non-`c` character.  The commented-out code suggests initial explorations into number theory functions (sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor counting, factorial, power, modular inverse, and combinations) which were ultimately not used in the final implementation.  The most significant changes occurred between 9:10 PM and 9:20 PM, with the final, functional version being completed around 9:23 PM.  A recurring theme is the handling of edge cases, particularly when the target character is not found or is present at the end of the string.  The data type `int` is defined as `long long`, indicating a need to handle larger integer values.
