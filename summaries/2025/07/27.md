# Activity Summary for 7/27/2025

## 8:50:03 PM
The log shows the evolution of the `A_Recycling_Center.cpp` file over a short period on July 27, 2025.  Initially, the code contained commented-out sections related to sieve methods, divisor calculations, and several mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr). These were not modified throughout the log.

The main focus of the changes was the `CutiePie()` function, which underwent significant revisions to solve a recycling center problem.  The initial version was empty.  Subsequent changes introduced input reading (n and c, then a vector v), sorting, and then attempts to implement the problem's logic using `lower_bound`. These attempts involved several iterations, with incomplete code and incorrect logic in some versions.

Between 8:06 PM and 8:11 PM, the core algorithm was developed iteratively, showing a progression towards a solution using `lower_bound` and vector manipulation.  The code was refined with multiple small edits, correcting syntax and logic.

A more efficient approach appeared between 8:21 PM and 8:22 PM.  A cleaned and more concise solution involving a `while` loop and utilizing the `lower_bound` function was implemented.

The final, correct solution was achieved at 8:26 PM. It uses a separate `calculateCost` function for better readability and efficiency, correctly handling the problem's constraints. This version also uses range-based for loops to make the code more compact and readable. The commented out code in the beginning, remained untouched.  The final change at 8:27 PM reverts to a version similar to prior iterations, but still maintains the commented-out code from the start.  The remainder of the log consists of further incomplete or incorrect attempts at the core algorithm, highlighting a struggle to arrive at the solution.  All further edits after 8:27 PM are attempts to debug a flawed algorithm, with the final, correct version appearing at 8:26 PM.
