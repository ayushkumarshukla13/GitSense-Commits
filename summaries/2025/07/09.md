# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 7:35:23 PM
The log shows edits to a single C++ file, `D_Matryoshkas.cpp`, between 6:35 PM and 6:43 PM on July 9, 2025.  The file appears to be implementing a solution to a programming problem.

Initially, the file contained a template with commented-out code for various mathematical functions (sieve, factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr). The `CutiePie` function was empty.

Between 6:43:02 PM and 6:43:08 PM, the `CutiePie` function was significantly modified. It now reads an integer `n`, takes `n` integer inputs into a vector `v`, and counts the frequency of each element using a map `mp`.  An `ans` variable is initialized to the minimum integer value, suggesting an intention to find a maximum value.  However, the loop to find the maximum is incomplete at 6:43:08 PM.

At 6:43:22 PM, the `CutiePie` function was completed. The loop iterates through the map `mp` to find the maximum frequency (`ans`) and prints it to the console.  The final version of the code at 6:43:27 PM is identical to that at 6:43:22 PM.

The commented-out code remains unchanged throughout the edits, suggesting that it was not part of the primary development effort during this time period. The main change involved the development of the `CutiePie` function to solve a problem involving finding the maximum frequency of elements in an input list.
