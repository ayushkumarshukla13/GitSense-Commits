# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 12:47:52 PM
The log shows development on two C++ files: `E_Scuza.cpp` and `C_Removing_Smallest_Multiples.cpp`.

`E_Scuza.cpp` underwent significant changes between 9:51 AM and 10:18 AM.  Initially, the file contained a template with commented-out code for sieve, divisor calculation, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions.  The `CutiePie` function was empty.  Over several edits, the code evolved to take two inputs (n and q), read in two vectors (`vn` and `vq`), calculate a prefix sum vector (`pre`), and a maximum vector (`maxi`). Finally, it iterates through `vq` using `upper_bound` on `maxi` to find indices and print the corresponding values from `pre`, handling edge cases for zero values.  The final version efficiently solves a problem likely involving prefix sums and finding upper bounds in a sorted vector.

`C_Removing_Smallest_Multiples.cpp` was modified between 11:28 AM and 11:36 AM. It started as another template similar to `E_Scuza.cpp`. The  `CutiePie` function was then developed to solve a problem involving a string `s` and finding the sum of multiples of `i` that are not followed by a '1' in the string. The logic was iteratively refined. A vector `v` was used to track processed elements, initialized with all 1's, then changed to 0's, and finally correctly utilized to mark already processed indices.  The final code efficiently calculates a specific sum based on string input and avoids redundant calculations using `v`.  A leading '0' is prepended to `s` before processing to adjust the index handling in the nested loop.
