# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

The log shows modifications to Mongoose schemas within a bus tracking application's backend.

On July 14, 2025, at 2:54:06 PM, `busModel.js` was updated. This file defines a schema for bus information, including `busId`, `busName`, `busNumber`, driver details, route (using ObjectId referencing `BusRoute`), and an array of `busStandTimingSchema` objects.  `busStandTimingSchema` stores arrival and departure times (usual and actual) for each bus stop. A `pre-save` hook automatically assigns a unique `busId` by finding the highest existing ID and incrementing it.

At 3:00:53 PM and again at 3:00:59 PM, `busStandModel.js` was updated.  These updates involved modifications to the schema for bus stands. The initial version shows two schemas, `busStandSchema` (containing `name`, `busStandNumber`, and arrival/departure times) and `newBusStandSchema` (containing `name` and a unique `busStandId`). A commented-out line suggests an intended (but ultimately unimplemented) compound unique index for `name` and `busStandNumber` within `busStandSchema`. The second update to `busStandModel.js` (3:00:59 PM) appears to be near-identical to the first, suggesting a possible accidental duplicate commit or a minor, insignificant change that wasn't saved to the final code.  The final version of the file uses  `newBusStandSchema` to create the `busStand` model.
