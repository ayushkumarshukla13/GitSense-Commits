# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 12:57:17 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `C_Dolce_Vita.cpp` and `C_Differential_Sorting.cpp`.

`C_Dolce_Vita.cpp` underwent significant changes between 8:50 PM and 8:53 PM on July 21, 2025.  Initially, the code was incomplete.  The edits involved adding input reading for a vector `v`, calculating a prefix sum array `pre`, and finally computing an answer `ans` based on differences between `x` and elements of `pre`.  The final version calculates the answer using integer division and includes printing the result.  The commented-out code suggests the initial exploration of sieve methods and divisor calculations, which were ultimately not used in the final version.

`C_Differential_Sorting.cpp` was primarily worked on between 11:13 PM and 11:36 PM on July 21, 2025. The initial code was again incomplete.  The evolution of the code involved reading input into a vector `v`, checking for a specific condition (`v[n-2]>v[n-1]`), sorting the vector `a`, and comparing it with `v`.  A substantial portion of the edits focused on refining the logic to handle edge cases and correctly output the number of swaps required, finally resulting in a solution that prints the number of swaps or -1 if impossible.  The commented-out code is similar to `C_Dolce_Vita.cpp`, containing unused sieve and divisor calculation code.  There's a notable change from initially printing indices involved in swaps to printing only the number of swaps.

Both programs utilize similar boilerplate code, including the inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>`, common macros such as `#define int long long` and `#define MOD 1000000007`, and commented-out sieve and divisor calculation functions. This suggests a consistent coding style and possibly a template file used as a starting point for both programs.


## 8:57:16 PM
The log shows edits to two C++ files, `A_Difficult_Contest.cpp` and `B_Left_and_Down.cpp`, between 8:06 PM and 8:53 PM on July 22, 2025.

`A_Difficult_Contest.cpp` underwent several minor revisions to the `CutiePie` function. Initially, the function simply declared a string variable `s`. Subsequent changes involved attempts to incorporate string searching functions (`.find()`), possibly to check for substrings "FFT" and "NTT". Finally, a conditional statement was added; if "FFT" or "NTT" is found, the string `s` is sorted, then reversed and printed; otherwise, `s` is printed as is.  These changes happened rapidly, between 8:07 PM and 8:09 PM.

`B_Left_and_Down.cpp` shows a more substantial evolution of a function named `CutiePie`.  The function takes three integer inputs (`a`, `b`, `k`). The initial version was empty.  The code then developed a solution to a problem, iteratively adding conditions to handle different scenarios.  Initially, it checked if `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. Later, it added checks for `a` and `b` being 0, and it addressed the case where `a` equals `b`, considering the divisibility by `k`. The final version correctly handles various cases including where `a` and `b` are equal or where they are divisible by `k`, ultimately outputting either 0, 1, or 2 based on those conditions.  This development occurred between 8:15 PM and 8:53 PM, with the final solution implemented by 8:53 PM.

Both files contain commented-out code related to prime sieving and divisor calculations, suggesting the programmer might have initially considered using these functionalities but ultimately opted for a different approach.  The commented-out code was never modified throughout the log.  The consistent use of `#define int long long` in both files indicates the programmer's preference for using 64-bit integers.
