# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 12:57:17 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `C_Dolce_Vita.cpp` and `C_Differential_Sorting.cpp`.

`C_Dolce_Vita.cpp` underwent significant changes between 8:50 PM and 8:53 PM on July 21, 2025.  Initially, the code was incomplete.  The edits involved adding input reading for a vector `v`, calculating a prefix sum array `pre`, and finally computing an answer `ans` based on differences between `x` and elements of `pre`.  The final version calculates the answer using integer division and includes printing the result.  The commented-out code suggests the initial exploration of sieve methods and divisor calculations, which were ultimately not used in the final version.

`C_Differential_Sorting.cpp` was primarily worked on between 11:13 PM and 11:36 PM on July 21, 2025. The initial code was again incomplete.  The evolution of the code involved reading input into a vector `v`, checking for a specific condition (`v[n-2]>v[n-1]`), sorting the vector `a`, and comparing it with `v`.  A substantial portion of the edits focused on refining the logic to handle edge cases and correctly output the number of swaps required, finally resulting in a solution that prints the number of swaps or -1 if impossible.  The commented-out code is similar to `C_Dolce_Vita.cpp`, containing unused sieve and divisor calculation code.  There's a notable change from initially printing indices involved in swaps to printing only the number of swaps.

Both programs utilize similar boilerplate code, including the inclusion of `<bits/stdc++.h>`, common macros such as `#define int long long` and `#define MOD 1000000007`, and commented-out sieve and divisor calculation functions. This suggests a consistent coding style and possibly a template file used as a starting point for both programs.
