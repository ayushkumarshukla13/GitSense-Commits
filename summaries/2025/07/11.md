# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 4:33:33 AM
The log shows the development of a C++ program, likely solving a problem related to friends and a restaurant.  The `D_Friends_and_the_Restaurant.cpp` file undergoes several modifications between 4:31 AM and 4:33 AM on July 11, 2025.

Initially, the code included commented-out sections for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculation, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions.  These were likely explored initially but ultimately unused in the final solution.

The primary changes focus on the `CutiePie()` function.  The function's evolution is as follows:


* **4:31:35 AM:**  The function is incomplete, with only input `n` and vector declarations.
* **4:31:41 AM:** A `for` loop begins to be constructed for inputting elements into vector `a`.
* **4:31:50 AM:**  The `for` loop in `CutiePie` is completed for vector `a` using `push_back`.
* **4:32:02 AM:**  A second `for` loop is added to input elements into vector `b` using `push_back`.
* **4:32:19 AM:** Both vectors `a` and `b` are completely populated.
* **4:32:32 AM:** An `int ans = 0` and a `set<int> st` are introduced, suggesting the start of a core algorithm.
* **4:32:47 AM:** The algorithm starts taking shape; differences between elements of `b` and `a` are inserted into the `st` set.
* **4:33:07 AM:** The `CutiePie` function is seemingly complete, although the final use of the `st` set is missing.


The main function remains largely unchanged, indicating the focus of development was solely on the `CutiePie()` function's logic. The program reads an integer `qt`, likely representing the number of test cases, and then iterates through them by calling `CutiePie()` for each.  The commented-out code suggests some exploration of number theory functions, but these were not ultimately used in the final version of the code.
