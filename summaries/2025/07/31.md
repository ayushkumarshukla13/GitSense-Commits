# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 8:38:36 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`C_Make_Them_Equal.cpp`) over a period of about 30 minutes on July 31st, 2025.  The code implements a function `CutiePie` that processes a string `s` of length `n` and a character `c`.

The initial versions of `CutiePie` were incomplete and contained syntax errors (e.g., a missing `}` and a typo `strign` instead of `string`).  These were corrected in subsequent commits.  

Early versions of the function had logic flaws, including an incorrect loop condition and outputting incorrect results in various scenarios.The code was iteratively refined between 7:38 AM and 8:04 AM.  The primary focus of these revisions was the conditional logic within `CutiePie`, particularly handling cases where the input string is composed of only one character or when it needs to be broken up into two sets.  A significant change occurred around 7:55 AM where the code started correctly identifying and handling the case where the input character appears more than half the way through the sorted input string. The final version efficiently handles three cases: (1) all characters are equal to `c`, (2) `c` appears in the second half of a string with odd length, and (3) otherwise. The algorithm involves sorting the input string and identifying the index of `c`.

The commented-out sections of the code suggest that the initial intent was to include functions for prime checking, divisor counting, factorial calculation, power calculation, modular inverse and nCr calculations; however, these were not ultimately used in the final version of `CutiePie`.  The `main` function remains largely unchanged, focusing solely on reading input and calling `CutiePie`.
