# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 8:38:36 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`C_Make_Them_Equal.cpp`) over a period of about 30 minutes on July 31st, 2025.  The code implements a function `CutiePie` that processes a string `s` of length `n` and a character `c`.

The initial versions of `CutiePie` were incomplete and contained syntax errors (e.g., a missing `}` and a typo `strign` instead of `string`).  These were corrected in subsequent commits.  

Early versions of the function had logic flaws, including an incorrect loop condition and outputting incorrect results in various scenarios.The code was iteratively refined between 7:38 AM and 8:04 AM.  The primary focus of these revisions was the conditional logic within `CutiePie`, particularly handling cases where the input string is composed of only one character or when it needs to be broken up into two sets.  A significant change occurred around 7:55 AM where the code started correctly identifying and handling the case where the input character appears more than half the way through the sorted input string. The final version efficiently handles three cases: (1) all characters are equal to `c`, (2) `c` appears in the second half of a string with odd length, and (3) otherwise. The algorithm involves sorting the input string and identifying the index of `c`.

The commented-out sections of the code suggest that the initial intent was to include functions for prime checking, divisor counting, factorial calculation, power calculation, modular inverse and nCr calculations; however, these were not ultimately used in the final version of `CutiePie`.  The `main` function remains largely unchanged, focusing solely on reading input and calling `CutiePie`.


## 9:04:24 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `A_Submission_is_All_You_Need.cpp` and `B_Pathless.cpp`.

`A_Submission_is_All_You_Need.cpp` underwent significant changes between 8:10 PM and 8:22 PM.  Initially, the code was incomplete, with a `CutiePie` function that only declared a vector.  Subsequent edits added input reading, vector population, and sorting.  The final version calculates a sum, considering 0s as 1s,  based on input values and adds the count of zeros to obtain the final answer. This was achieved through multiple edits and incremental development, reflecting a process of refining the logic.

`B_Pathless.cpp` was modified between 8:46 PM and 9:02 PM.  The `CutiePie` function's purpose is to determine if a sum of input numbers exceeds a given target.  If the sum is greater than the target, it prints -1; otherwise, it attempts to distribute the remaining value (target - sum) among the input numbers. The code shows multiple incomplete attempts to devise this distribution logic before ending with an incomplete solution.  The final state of the code  still requires additional work to finish the algorithm intended.

Both files share a common header and define statements,  including commented-out code for sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculations, suggesting potential reuse of common functionality.  The commented-out code might indicate that alternative approaches were considered or that the developer is maintaining options for future use.  The `main` function is consistently structured for processing multiple test cases.
