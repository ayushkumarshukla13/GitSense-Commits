# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 1:30:52 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `B_Make_Almost_Equal_With_Mod.cpp` and `D_Plus_Minus_Permutation.cpp`.  `B_Make_Almost_Equal_With_Mod.cpp` underwent significant changes between 12:33 AM and 12:36 AM, primarily focusing on the `CutiePie` function.  Initially, this function was empty.  It was then progressively developed to read input `n`,  create a vector `v`, and then utilize maps and sets to process the data, finally culminating in a solution involving modulo operations and a `while` loop that terminates when a specific condition is met. The final version calculates an answer based on the modulo operation and the size of the set. The code also contains numerous commented-out sections suggesting earlier attempts at different algorithms (sieve, calculating divisors and factorial, power and inverse modulo functions, and nCr).

`D_Plus_Minus_Permutation.cpp`, modified between 12:59 AM and 1:03 AM, shows the development of the `CutiePie` function to solve a problem involving  calculations based on inputs `n`, `x`, and `y`. The  process involved calculating intermediate variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using  division and greatest common divisor (`__gcd`). The final version uses these variables to calculate and output a final result. Similar to the other file, commented-out code shows attempts at other potentially relevant functionalities.  There is a noticeable pattern of iterative refinement in both files, with incremental changes improving the solution over a short period.  The use of commented-out code suggests an experimental approach to problem-solving.


## 2:18:39 PM
The log shows the evolution of the `B_Playing_in_a_Casino.cpp` file between 1:18 PM and 1:26 PM on July 1st, 2025.  The primary changes involve the `CutiePie` function, which initially declared variables `n` and `m` but lacked functionality.

The code undergoes several iterations, gradually adding a 2D vector `v`.  Initially, the vector's dimensions are incomplete or missing entirely. Over time, the code evolves to correctly create a `v` vector of size `n x m`, reading input values into it.  Between 1:25 PM and 1:26 PM, a second 2D vector `v1` of size `m x n` is introduced, populating it with the transpose of vector `v`. This suggests the implementation of a matrix transposition algorithm.  All changes are focused within the `CutiePie` function; the rest of the commented-out code remains unchanged throughout the log.  The commented-out code includes various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) and sieve-related code for prime number generation.  These functions are not utilized within the final version shown in the log.


## 8:18:42 PM
The log shows development on four C++ files within the `Cp_ALGO` directory.  The most significant changes are in `A_Blackboard_Game.cpp` and `B_Tournament.cpp`.

`A_Blackboard_Game.cpp`: This file underwent several revisions between 8:07 PM and 8:10 PM. The core change involved implementing the game logic within the `CutiePie` function. Initially, the function only read input (`cin >> n`). It was then modified to check if `n` is divisible by 4, outputting "Bob" if true. Finally, the code was completed to output "Alice" otherwise, providing a complete solution to the problem.


`B_Tournament.cpp`: This file shows a more extensive development process from 8:14 PM to 8:18 PM. The `CutiePie` function was progressively built:
* Initially, it just declared variables.
* Then, input was read into a vector `v`.
* The vector `v` was sorted.
* A `map` `m` was introduced to count the occurrences of each element in a sub-array of `v`.
* Finally, the logic to count the number of duplicate elements in the sub-array (`ct`) was implemented correctly, completing the solution.

Both `A_Blackboard_Game.cpp` and `B_Tournament.cpp` use the same boilerplate code, including numerous commented-out code segments related to prime numbers, divisors, factorials, power calculations, and modular arithmetic. This suggests that the commented-out code was either experimental or previously used for other problems.  The commented-out code is never modified in the log.  Both files use `#define int long long` and `#define MOD 1000000007`, indicating a focus on solving problems requiring large integers and modular arithmetic.  The main function in both files reads a single test case, which is then handled by the `CutiePie` function, a common pattern in competitive programming.  The `CutiePie` function name is a recurring element.  There is no change logged for `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\B_Playing_in_a_Casino.cpp`.


## 9:18:51 PM
The log shows a single file, `B_Tournament.cpp`, undergoing numerous modifications between 7/1/2025, 8:19 PM and 9:18 PM.  The initial code contains a commented-out section with various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr) and a `CutiePie` function that seems to process a vector of integers.  This function initially involved sorting and counting occurrences of elements.

Subsequent changes to `CutiePie` reflect an iterative refinement of the algorithm's logic.  The code is repeatedly modified, with incomplete statements and debugging attempts visible in several entries.  There are multiple attempts at different approaches to solve a problem, evidenced by the frequent changes in the `CutiePie` function logic, before finally arriving at a solution involving sorting, counting element occurrences using a map, and checking if a condition based on the input values (`n`, `j`, `k`) holds. The final version of `CutiePie` efficiently determines if a condition is met, returning "YES" or "NO" based on that condition. The final implemented logic is concise and focuses on comparing the value at index `j-1` in the sorted input vector with the rest of the elements.

The commented-out code suggests that the programmer initially considered using sieves and divisor calculations, but ultimately decided against implementing them in the final version.  The commented code is consistently present throughout all the edits in the log. The final working code is significantly simpler and more efficient than the initially planned approach.  Several intermediate versions are incomplete or contain syntax errors, demonstrating the iterative and debugging-oriented nature of the code development process.
