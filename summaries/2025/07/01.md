# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 1:30:52 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `B_Make_Almost_Equal_With_Mod.cpp` and `D_Plus_Minus_Permutation.cpp`.  `B_Make_Almost_Equal_With_Mod.cpp` underwent significant changes between 12:33 AM and 12:36 AM, primarily focusing on the `CutiePie` function.  Initially, this function was empty.  It was then progressively developed to read input `n`,  create a vector `v`, and then utilize maps and sets to process the data, finally culminating in a solution involving modulo operations and a `while` loop that terminates when a specific condition is met. The final version calculates an answer based on the modulo operation and the size of the set. The code also contains numerous commented-out sections suggesting earlier attempts at different algorithms (sieve, calculating divisors and factorial, power and inverse modulo functions, and nCr).

`D_Plus_Minus_Permutation.cpp`, modified between 12:59 AM and 1:03 AM, shows the development of the `CutiePie` function to solve a problem involving  calculations based on inputs `n`, `x`, and `y`. The  process involved calculating intermediate variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using  division and greatest common divisor (`__gcd`). The final version uses these variables to calculate and output a final result. Similar to the other file, commented-out code shows attempts at other potentially relevant functionalities.  There is a noticeable pattern of iterative refinement in both files, with incremental changes improving the solution over a short period.  The use of commented-out code suggests an experimental approach to problem-solving.


## 2:18:39 PM
The log shows the evolution of the `B_Playing_in_a_Casino.cpp` file between 1:18 PM and 1:26 PM on July 1st, 2025.  The primary changes involve the `CutiePie` function, which initially declared variables `n` and `m` but lacked functionality.

The code undergoes several iterations, gradually adding a 2D vector `v`.  Initially, the vector's dimensions are incomplete or missing entirely. Over time, the code evolves to correctly create a `v` vector of size `n x m`, reading input values into it.  Between 1:25 PM and 1:26 PM, a second 2D vector `v1` of size `m x n` is introduced, populating it with the transpose of vector `v`. This suggests the implementation of a matrix transposition algorithm.  All changes are focused within the `CutiePie` function; the rest of the commented-out code remains unchanged throughout the log.  The commented-out code includes various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) and sieve-related code for prime number generation.  These functions are not utilized within the final version shown in the log.


## 8:18:42 PM
The log shows development on four C++ files within the `Cp_ALGO` directory.  The most significant changes are in `A_Blackboard_Game.cpp` and `B_Tournament.cpp`.

`A_Blackboard_Game.cpp`: This file underwent several revisions between 8:07 PM and 8:10 PM. The core change involved implementing the game logic within the `CutiePie` function. Initially, the function only read input (`cin >> n`). It was then modified to check if `n` is divisible by 4, outputting "Bob" if true. Finally, the code was completed to output "Alice" otherwise, providing a complete solution to the problem.


`B_Tournament.cpp`: This file shows a more extensive development process from 8:14 PM to 8:18 PM. The `CutiePie` function was progressively built:
* Initially, it just declared variables.
* Then, input was read into a vector `v`.
* The vector `v` was sorted.
* A `map` `m` was introduced to count the occurrences of each element in a sub-array of `v`.
* Finally, the logic to count the number of duplicate elements in the sub-array (`ct`) was implemented correctly, completing the solution.

Both `A_Blackboard_Game.cpp` and `B_Tournament.cpp` use the same boilerplate code, including numerous commented-out code segments related to prime numbers, divisors, factorials, power calculations, and modular arithmetic. This suggests that the commented-out code was either experimental or previously used for other problems.  The commented-out code is never modified in the log.  Both files use `#define int long long` and `#define MOD 1000000007`, indicating a focus on solving problems requiring large integers and modular arithmetic.  The main function in both files reads a single test case, which is then handled by the `CutiePie` function, a common pattern in competitive programming.  The `CutiePie` function name is a recurring element.  There is no change logged for `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\B_Playing_in_a_Casino.cpp`.
