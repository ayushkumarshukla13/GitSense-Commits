# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 1:30:52 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `B_Make_Almost_Equal_With_Mod.cpp` and `D_Plus_Minus_Permutation.cpp`.  `B_Make_Almost_Equal_With_Mod.cpp` underwent significant changes between 12:33 AM and 12:36 AM, primarily focusing on the `CutiePie` function.  Initially, this function was empty.  It was then progressively developed to read input `n`,  create a vector `v`, and then utilize maps and sets to process the data, finally culminating in a solution involving modulo operations and a `while` loop that terminates when a specific condition is met. The final version calculates an answer based on the modulo operation and the size of the set. The code also contains numerous commented-out sections suggesting earlier attempts at different algorithms (sieve, calculating divisors and factorial, power and inverse modulo functions, and nCr).

`D_Plus_Minus_Permutation.cpp`, modified between 12:59 AM and 1:03 AM, shows the development of the `CutiePie` function to solve a problem involving  calculations based on inputs `n`, `x`, and `y`. The  process involved calculating intermediate variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using  division and greatest common divisor (`__gcd`). The final version uses these variables to calculate and output a final result. Similar to the other file, commented-out code shows attempts at other potentially relevant functionalities.  There is a noticeable pattern of iterative refinement in both files, with incremental changes improving the solution over a short period.  The use of commented-out code suggests an experimental approach to problem-solving.
