# Activity Summary for 8/30/2025

## 12:55:34 PM
The log shows the evolution of the `B_Like_the_Bitset.cpp` and `C_Against_the_Difference.cpp` files.  `B_Like_the_Bitset.cpp` underwent significant changes between 10:55 AM and 11:02 AM.  Initially, the `CutiePie` function was empty.  The code was then progressively developed to read input (n, m, string s), process the string to find the maximum consecutive '1's, and then generate an output vector `v` based on the input string. The final version efficiently uses a `set` and a vector to solve the problem, printing "YES" followed by the elements of the `v` vector.  The algorithm checks for a condition based on consecutive 1s in the input string; if this condition is satisfied, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it constructs and prints a vector.  There are many commented-out code blocks that were likely related to other algorithms which are not used in the final version.

Between 10:55:32 AM and 10:57:51 AM, multiple commits show incremental development of the core logic within the `CutiePie` function. The last commit of the `B_Like_the_Bitset.cpp` at 11:02:45 AM corrected the loop condition in the `CutiePie` function, changing  `for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)` to `for(int i=0;i<n;i++)`.

The file `C_Against_the_Difference.cpp` shows a single entry at 11:19:49 AM. The `CutiePie` function reads an integer `n` and then `n` integers into a vector `v`. This function is largely incomplete.  It lacks processing logic and output.  The commented-out code sections in both files appear to be remnants of previously considered algorithms.  This suggests iterative development and experimentation.
