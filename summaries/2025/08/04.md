# Activity Summary for 8/4/2025

## 1:45:38 AM
The log shows the evolution of the `B_Flip_the_Bits.cpp` file over a short period on August 3rd, 2025, between 11:41 PM and 11:47 PM.  The code implements a solution to a problem involving flipping bits in a binary string.

Initially, the code contained commented-out code for sieve of Eratosthenes, calculation of divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions, suggesting an earlier exploration of different approaches. These were not ultimately used in the final version.

The core logic progressively developed within the `CutiePie()` function.  Early versions focused on counting zeros and ones in input strings `a` and `b`. The algorithm then iterated through the strings from right to left. A `changed` boolean variable tracked whether a flip had occurred. The code underwent several iterations to refine the conditions for flipping bits and handling the counts of zeros and ones accurately to determine if a transformation from string `a` to `b` is possible based on the constraints.

The final version, achieved around 11:47 PM, efficiently checks if string `b` can be obtained from string `a` by flipping bits while maintaining the balance between zeros and ones.  The program prints "YES" if the transformation is possible, and "NO" otherwise. The commented-out helper functions remained unused throughout.

A new file, `B_Cat_Cycle.cpp`, was created at 1:44 AM on August 4th, 2025. This file currently contains a basic structure similar to `B_Flip_the_Bits.cpp`, including the same commented out helper functions, but its `CutiePie` function is empty, suggesting this is a new problem's code that is yet to be implemented.
