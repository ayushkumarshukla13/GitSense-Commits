# Activity Summary for 8/7/2025

## 2:53:48 PM
The log shows a single file, `H_Maximal_AND.cpp`, undergoing numerous modifications between 2:20 PM and 2:53 PM on August 7, 2025.  The initial commits contain a large commented-out section with code for various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr), a commented-out sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers, and a commented-out function to calculate the number of divisors.  The `CutiePie` function initially was empty, then underwent significant changes to read integer inputs, process them, and finally calculate an answer based on bitwise operations and input parameters `n` and `m`.

The core logic involves:

1. Reading input values `n` and `m`.
2. Reading a vector `v` of `n` integers.
3. Counting the number of times each bit (0-30) is set in the input vector `v` and storing it in `v1`.
4. Reversing `v1`.
5. Performing a loop that iteratively checks a condition involving `n`, `m`, and the count of set bits in `v1`.  This condition appears to determine bits to set in an `ans` variable based on the constraints imposed by `m` and `n`.
6. Finally, printing the `ans` value.

The commented-out sections suggest the programmer initially explored various mathematical algorithms before settling on the bitwise approach.  The significant changes between 2:20 PM and 2:53 PM reflect the iterative refinement of the core algorithm within `CutiePie`  to solve the problem accurately.  The final version removes the commented-out code and directly incorporates input and output functions.
