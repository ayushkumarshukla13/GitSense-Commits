# Activity Summary for 8/24/2025

## 8:53:15 PM
The log shows development of two C++ programs, `A_Redstone.cpp` and `B_Villagers.cpp`.

`A_Redstone.cpp`:  This file underwent several minor revisions between 8:12 PM and 8:13 PM on August 24, 2025.  The core change involved the `CutiePie` function. Initially, it only read input into a vector. It was then modified to use a map to count the frequency of each input integer. Finally, the function checks if any integer appears at least twice, outputting "YES" if so and "NO" otherwise.  The commented-out code suggests earlier attempts at implementing sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculation functions which were ultimately not used in the final version.

`B_Villagers.cpp`: This file shows a more substantial evolution between 8:14 PM and 8:53 PM on August 24, 2025.  The initial version of `CutiePie` was empty.  Subsequent edits involved:

1. **Input and Sorting:** Input was added, along with sorting the input vector `v`.
2. **Incorrect Greedy Approach:**  Multiple attempts were made at implementing a greedy algorithm to solve the problem, involving repeatedly taking the maximum from the sorted vector. These attempts (8:29 PM - 8:32 PM) were flawed and incomplete.
3. **Vector Manipulation:** The code involved manipulating the `v` vector during the greedy algorithm.  Attempts to remove elements (using `erase` and `pop_back`) were made, but with incorrect logic.
4. **Final Correct Solution:**  The algorithm was ultimately rewritten (8:32 PM - 8:33 PM) to correctly handle the problem, resulting in a more efficient approach.  The vector `v` is iterated through in reverse, summing up the maximum values from pairs of consecutive elements. This approach effectively solves the problem efficiently without needing to repeatedly remove elements from a vector. After that the code remained unchanged.  A final optimization (8:45 PM) replaced the vector operations with a simpler iterative approach and removed the comments and unused code.  There were a few transient edits around 8:49 to 8:53 PM, experimenting with sets and multisets to accomplish the same task, but these were abandoned in favor of the optimized iterative approach.

A common pattern in both files is the presence of commented-out code, suggesting an iterative development process where various approaches were tried before arriving at the final solution.  Both files also initially included commented-out code related to sieve and divisor calculations that were ultimately not used.
