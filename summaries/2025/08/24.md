# Activity Summary for 8/24/2025

## 8:53:15 PM
The log shows development of two C++ programs, `A_Redstone.cpp` and `B_Villagers.cpp`.

`A_Redstone.cpp`:  This file underwent several minor revisions between 8:12 PM and 8:13 PM on August 24, 2025.  The core change involved the `CutiePie` function. Initially, it only read input into a vector. It was then modified to use a map to count the frequency of each input integer. Finally, the function checks if any integer appears at least twice, outputting "YES" if so and "NO" otherwise.  The commented-out code suggests earlier attempts at implementing sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculation functions which were ultimately not used in the final version.

`B_Villagers.cpp`: This file shows a more substantial evolution between 8:14 PM and 8:53 PM on August 24, 2025.  The initial version of `CutiePie` was empty.  Subsequent edits involved:

1. **Input and Sorting:** Input was added, along with sorting the input vector `v`.
2. **Incorrect Greedy Approach:**  Multiple attempts were made at implementing a greedy algorithm to solve the problem, involving repeatedly taking the maximum from the sorted vector. These attempts (8:29 PM - 8:32 PM) were flawed and incomplete.
3. **Vector Manipulation:** The code involved manipulating the `v` vector during the greedy algorithm.  Attempts to remove elements (using `erase` and `pop_back`) were made, but with incorrect logic.
4. **Final Correct Solution:**  The algorithm was ultimately rewritten (8:32 PM - 8:33 PM) to correctly handle the problem, resulting in a more efficient approach.  The vector `v` is iterated through in reverse, summing up the maximum values from pairs of consecutive elements. This approach effectively solves the problem efficiently without needing to repeatedly remove elements from a vector. After that the code remained unchanged.  A final optimization (8:45 PM) replaced the vector operations with a simpler iterative approach and removed the comments and unused code.  There were a few transient edits around 8:49 to 8:53 PM, experimenting with sets and multisets to accomplish the same task, but these were abandoned in favor of the optimized iterative approach.

A common pattern in both files is the presence of commented-out code, suggesting an iterative development process where various approaches were tried before arriving at the final solution.  Both files also initially included commented-out code related to sieve and divisor calculations that were ultimately not used.


## 11:24:16 PM
The log shows edits to two C++ files: `Missing_Number.cpp` and `Repetitions.cpp`, and one empty file `Untitled-1`.  The `Missing_Number.cpp` file underwent several revisions between 10:24 PM and 10:26 PM on August 24th, 2025. These changes primarily focused on refining the `CutiePie` function, which calculates a missing number from a sequence. The initial version had a flawed loop condition and lacked the final output; subsequent revisions corrected the loop, added the missing calculation, and ensured the output of the absolute difference.

The `Repetitions.cpp` file was modified between 10:28 PM and 10:34 PM on the same day. The evolution of the `CutiePie` function in this file shows a process of developing a solution to find the maximum consecutive repetition of a character in a string.  Initially, the function was empty.  It progressed through stages involving sorting the string, counting consecutive characters, and finally reaching a correct implementation that outputs the maximum count using `max()`.  The final version correctly handles edge cases and efficiently determines the maximum repetition count.  Note that there's commented-out code across both files that appears to be related to sieving for primes and calculating divisors, suggesting these were explored but ultimately removed from the main logic.  The main function in both files consistently reads a single test case, implying the code is structured to handle multiple inputs, even though only one case is processed in the log.
