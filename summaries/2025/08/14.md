# Activity Summary for 8/14/2025

## 2:07:04 PM
The log shows a single code change to `Grid_MEX.cpp` on August 14, 2025, at 1:07:04 PM.  The file contains a C++ program.  The code includes numerous commented-out functions for tasks such as calculating factorials, powers, modular inverses, and binomial coefficients (nCr).  There are also commented-out sections related to sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers and calculating the number of divisors.  The main function currently only reads an integer `qt` and then calls an empty function `CutiePie` `qt` times.  The commented-out code suggests the program was initially intended to perform various mathematical computations, but the current active implementation is minimal.
