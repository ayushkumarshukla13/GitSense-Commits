# Activity Summary for 8/29/2025

## 6:33:47 PM
The log shows edits to two C++ files: `B_Like_the_Bitset.cpp` and `A_Ternary_Search.cpp`.  `B_Like_the_Bitset.cpp` underwent two edits at 5:43 PM and 5:49 PM on August 29, 2025, but the code content is not provided, preventing a detailed analysis of these changes.

`A_Ternary_Search.cpp` shows a series of edits between 6:08 PM and 6:17 PM on August 29, 2025.  The initial version contained commented-out code for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions.  The main focus of the edits was the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` simply read two integers, `n` and `x`.  Subsequent edits added functionality to read `n` integers into a vector `v`.  Further modifications involved checking if `x` exists in the vector.  The final version checks if `x` is at the beginning (index 1), end (index n), or at any index divisible by 3. If any of these are true, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1.  The code includes standard input/output optimizations (`ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`).  The commented-out code suggests the file may have previously included more extensive mathematical functions.  The frequent edits to `CutiePie` indicate iterative development and debugging of the logic related to the position of 'x' within the input vector 'v'.
