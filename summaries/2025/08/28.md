# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 1:03:44 AM
The log shows the development of a C++ program (`A_Painting_With_Two_Colors.cpp`) over a short period on August 28th, 2025.  The file underwent several revisions between 12:04 AM and 12:20 AM.

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse and nCr functions. These were likely placeholders or remnants from previous development stages. The `CutiePie` function was initially empty.

Between 12:04 AM and 12:05 AM, the `CutiePie` function was updated to take three integer inputs (n, a, b) from the standard input.

Subsequent changes, from 12:20 AM to 12:20:37 AM, focused on adding logic within the `CutiePie` function. This involved determining the maximum of a and b, assigning it to `qt`, and implementing a conditional statement (`if(n%2==qt%2 && n%2==b%2)`) to print "YES" or "NO" based on the parity of n, qt and b.  The final version added an `else` block to explicitly print "NO" when the condition is false.  These changes suggest the program is solving a problem related to parity and comparing input values.  The commented-out code was untouched throughout this process.


## 10:59:31 AM
The file `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\B_Add_0_or_K.cpp` underwent three modifications on August 28, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the `CutiePie` function.

The first two changes at 10:03:28 AM and 10:03:38 AM were minor.  The second revision added an empty for loop inside the `CutiePie` function.


The most significant change occurred at 10:03:52 AM. This revision added code within the `CutiePie` function to read `n` integers from the standard input and store them in a vector named `v`.  This suggests the function's purpose is now to process a sequence of numbers. The rest of the code, including commented-out sections related to sieve, divisors calculations, and other mathematical functions, remained unchanged throughout all three revisions.  These commented-out sections indicate that the programmer may have explored different approaches or algorithms before settling on the current implementation.
