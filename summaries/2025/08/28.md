# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 1:03:44 AM
The log shows the development of a C++ program (`A_Painting_With_Two_Colors.cpp`) over a short period on August 28th, 2025.  The file underwent several revisions between 12:04 AM and 12:20 AM.

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse and nCr functions. These were likely placeholders or remnants from previous development stages. The `CutiePie` function was initially empty.

Between 12:04 AM and 12:05 AM, the `CutiePie` function was updated to take three integer inputs (n, a, b) from the standard input.

Subsequent changes, from 12:20 AM to 12:20:37 AM, focused on adding logic within the `CutiePie` function. This involved determining the maximum of a and b, assigning it to `qt`, and implementing a conditional statement (`if(n%2==qt%2 && n%2==b%2)`) to print "YES" or "NO" based on the parity of n, qt and b.  The final version added an `else` block to explicitly print "NO" when the condition is false.  These changes suggest the program is solving a problem related to parity and comparing input values.  The commented-out code was untouched throughout this process.
