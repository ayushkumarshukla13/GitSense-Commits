# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 1:03:44 AM
The log shows the development of a C++ program (`A_Painting_With_Two_Colors.cpp`) over a short period on August 28th, 2025.  The file underwent several revisions between 12:04 AM and 12:20 AM.

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse and nCr functions. These were likely placeholders or remnants from previous development stages. The `CutiePie` function was initially empty.

Between 12:04 AM and 12:05 AM, the `CutiePie` function was updated to take three integer inputs (n, a, b) from the standard input.

Subsequent changes, from 12:20 AM to 12:20:37 AM, focused on adding logic within the `CutiePie` function. This involved determining the maximum of a and b, assigning it to `qt`, and implementing a conditional statement (`if(n%2==qt%2 && n%2==b%2)`) to print "YES" or "NO" based on the parity of n, qt and b.  The final version added an `else` block to explicitly print "NO" when the condition is false.  These changes suggest the program is solving a problem related to parity and comparing input values.  The commented-out code was untouched throughout this process.


## 10:59:31 AM
The file `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\B_Add_0_or_K.cpp` underwent three modifications on August 28, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the `CutiePie` function.

The first two changes at 10:03:28 AM and 10:03:38 AM were minor.  The second revision added an empty for loop inside the `CutiePie` function.


The most significant change occurred at 10:03:52 AM. This revision added code within the `CutiePie` function to read `n` integers from the standard input and store them in a vector named `v`.  This suggests the function's purpose is now to process a sequence of numbers. The rest of the code, including commented-out sections related to sieve, divisors calculations, and other mathematical functions, remained unchanged throughout all three revisions.  These commented-out sections indicate that the programmer may have explored different approaches or algorithms before settling on the current implementation.


## 4:47:57 PM
The log shows development of two C++ programs, `B_Add_0_or_K.cpp` and `C_Even_Larger.cpp`.

`B_Add_0_or_K.cpp` underwent several rapid revisions between 2:39 PM and 2:40 PM on August 28, 2025.  The core change involved adding code within the `CutiePie()` function to process input values (`v[i]`) based on a modulo operation with `(m+1)`, and then adding a value (initially incomplete, then corrected to `(x*m)` and finally `(x*m)`) to the `v[i]` element.  The commented-out code suggests the program may have originally included functionality for sieving primes and calculating divisors, although this functionality wasn't used in the final version present in the log.

`C_Even_Larger.cpp` shows a more substantial evolution from 2:44 PM to 4:30 PM on the same day. The program aims to calculate a value based on an input vector. The initial version of the `CutiePie` function was empty.  Subsequent changes involved:
1. Reading input into a vector `v`.
2. Iterating through the vector, initially with a flawed condition and logic for counting (`ct`).
3. Refining the condition and logic to focus on even indices and comparing elements at even and next odd indices (`v[i]` and `v[i+1]`).
4. Correcting the calculation of `ct` to account for the absolute difference between elements and adding 1 in certain situations.
5. Changing the comparison from `v[i] < v[i+1]` to `v[i] > v[i+1]`.
6.  Implementing an algorithm that iterates through the vector, calculating a value `a` based on adjacent elements, and updating `v[i+1]` and `ans` accordingly. It uses a conditional check (`if(a >= v[i])`), and incorporates error handling for negative values in `v[i+1]`.  The final version includes a check for even `n` to handle a boundary condition.

A common pattern in both files is the inclusion of heavily commented-out code related to number theory functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations), and algorithms (sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor count). This indicates the programmer explored different approaches before settling on the presented logic.  The function name `CutiePie()` is consistently used as a wrapper for the main logic in both files.
