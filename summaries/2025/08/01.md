# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 1:20:02 PM
The log shows a single file, `C:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\C_Double_Perspective.cpp`, undergoing numerous modifications between 2:03:56 AM and 2:29:11 AM on August 1st, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was incomplete.  Over several minutes, the code evolved, adding input functionality (reading integers `x` and `y`), using a `vector<pair<int, int>>` to store pairs, and then transitioning to using a `map` (first a `map<pair<int,int>,int>`, then `map<int,int>`)  to store and process the input data.  There were several attempts to correctly handle inserting and updating data within the map, resolving potential issues with `mp.insert()` and map key lookups (`mp.find()`).  The ultimate goal appears to be to count unique keys in the map and print specific values associated with those keys.

Between 2:10:44 AM and 2:10:56 AM, there's a brief period where the code is incomplete and the `map` declaration seems to have an error. Similarly there are some incomplete code present between 2:13:47 AM and 2:14:01 AM, and 2:20:00 AM and 2:20:57 AM where the code was incomplete and also deleted at some points. The commented-out code at the beginning of the file suggests the programmer was exploring various algorithms related to primes, divisors, and combinatorics, although this commented code wasn't modified in the log. The final version of `CutiePie` at 2:29:11 AM successfully processes the input, counts unique keys, and prints the associated values.  The main function consistently calls `CutiePie()` in a loop, suggesting the intention is to process multiple test cases.
