# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 1:20:02 PM
The log shows a single file, `C:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\C_Double_Perspective.cpp`, undergoing numerous modifications between 2:03:56 AM and 2:29:11 AM on August 1st, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was incomplete.  Over several minutes, the code evolved, adding input functionality (reading integers `x` and `y`), using a `vector<pair<int, int>>` to store pairs, and then transitioning to using a `map` (first a `map<pair<int,int>,int>`, then `map<int,int>`)  to store and process the input data.  There were several attempts to correctly handle inserting and updating data within the map, resolving potential issues with `mp.insert()` and map key lookups (`mp.find()`).  The ultimate goal appears to be to count unique keys in the map and print specific values associated with those keys.

Between 2:10:44 AM and 2:10:56 AM, there's a brief period where the code is incomplete and the `map` declaration seems to have an error. Similarly there are some incomplete code present between 2:13:47 AM and 2:14:01 AM, and 2:20:00 AM and 2:20:57 AM where the code was incomplete and also deleted at some points. The commented-out code at the beginning of the file suggests the programmer was exploring various algorithms related to primes, divisors, and combinatorics, although this commented code wasn't modified in the log. The final version of `CutiePie` at 2:29:11 AM successfully processes the input, counts unique keys, and prints the associated values.  The main function consistently calls `CutiePie()` in a loop, suggesting the intention is to process multiple test cases.


## 3:58:26 PM
The log shows development of two C++ code files, `D_Stay_or_Mirror.cpp` and `C_Make_Them_Equal.cpp`, along with significant modifications to `LabDA01.CPP`.

`D_Stay_or_Mirror.cpp` underwent a single, isolated modification at 2:41:31 PM on August 1st, 2025.  The content of this change is not shown.


`LabDA01.CPP` experienced a series of incremental changes between 2:42:27 PM and 2:42:57 PM on August 1st, 2025.  Initially, it contained commented-out code for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculations, factorial, power, and modular inverse functions. These were subsequently removed. The `CutiePie()` function was initially empty, then had an integer `n` added, followed by `n` and `x` declared with input `cin>>n>>x;`.  This suggests the programmer was iteratively building a function to take two integer inputs.

`C_Make_Them_Equal.cpp` shows development of a function that searches for a specific element (x) in an array (arr).  Changes between 2:43:15 PM and 2:45:18 PM show the function being fleshed out:  It initially takes inputs n and x, creates an array arr of size 10 and populates it. A loop is added to search for x in arr, then prints "YES" and the index if found. The final version correctly includes a `return;` statement after printing the result.  There's a clear pattern of iterative debugging and refinement, with each commit adding or correcting a small part of the functionality.
