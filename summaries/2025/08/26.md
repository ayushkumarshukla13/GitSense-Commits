# Activity Summary for 8/26/2025

## 9:40:19 AM
The log shows the evolution of the `Concert_Tickets.cpp` file over a period of approximately one hour, from August 25th, 11:57 PM to August 26th, 12:17 AM.  The initial commits contained commented-out code related to sieve methods (likely for prime number generation or divisor calculation), and various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations).  These were seemingly unused and were not part of the main logic.

Between 11:57 PM and 11:59 PM on August 25th, a significant change occurred: the `CutiePie` function was fleshed out to read integers into a vector.  Subsequent commits (August 26th, 12:00 AM - 12:04 AM) refined `CutiePie` further.  The function now takes two integers as input (n and m), reads n integers into vector 'a' and m integers into vector 'b', creates a vector 'c' and sorts 'a'. The logic attempted to iterate through 'b', finding the largest element in 'a' less than or equal to the current element in 'b'. It then intended to output this found element and remove it from 'a' using `a.erase(qt)`, which had a few syntax errors that were gradually corrected.  There were also issues with the handling of cases where no suitable element exists in 'a', which was resolved by checking if `qt` is equal to `a.begin()` in later commits.

Finally, between 12:09 AM and 12:17 AM on August 26th, the code underwent a major restructuring.  The `a` vector was replaced by a `multiset` to enable efficient searching and removal of elements. The solution uses `upper_bound` to find the largest element less than or equal to the query element. This is a much cleaner and more efficient approach than the previous attempts. The commented-out mathematical functions were removed in the final commit.  The final code is a concise and efficient solution to the concert ticket problem, utilizing standard library functions like `multiset` and `upper_bound` for optimal performance.


## 1:24:20 PM
The log shows development of a backend application, starting with basic setup and progressing to user authentication and authorization features.

**`package.json`**: This file was updated twice.  Initially (12:29:00 PM), it defined the project's dependencies as `cookie-parser`, `dotenv`, `express`, and `mongoose`.  Later (12:43:14 PM and 12:54:11 PM), `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `redis`, and `validator` were added, indicating the addition of user authentication and potentially caching functionalities.

**`src/config/db.js`**:  This file (12:29:57 PM) contains a function that establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using the connection string from the `.env` file.

**`src/models/user.js`**: This file (12:30:23 PM) defines a Mongoose schema for users, including fields like `firstName`, `lastName`, `emailId`, `age`, `role`, and `problemSolved`.  Timestamps are enabled for the schema.

**`src/index.js`**: This file was updated multiple times. The initial version (12:30:46 PM) sets up an Express.js server, loads environment variables, connects to the database, and starts listening on the port specified in the `.env` file. A later update (12:54:02 PM) incorporates the authentication routes, establishes a connection to a Redis database using `redisClient.connect()`, and handles both database and Redis connection attempts within a single `async` function.

**`package-lock.json`**: This file was updated twice, reflecting changes in the `package.json` dependencies (12:31:25 PM and 12:43:05 PM and 12:54:19 PM).  It shows a detailed dependency tree, confirming the inclusion of new packages for user authentication and Redis.

**`.gitignore`**: This file (12:33:56 PM) specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, including environment files, log files, and build artifacts.  This is a standard file for version control.

**`src/controllers/userAuthent.js`**: This file (12:40:39 PM) contains controller functions for user registration (`register`), login (`login`), and logout (`logout`).  It uses bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for generating JWTs.  Cookies are used to store the token after successful login.

**`src/routes/userAuth.js`**: This file (12:41:55 PM) defines Express.js routes for user authentication, including `/register`, `/login`, and `/logout`.

**`src/utils/validator.js`**: This file (12:42:29 PM) contains a validation function (`validate`) that checks for mandatory fields and validates email format and password strength using the `validator` package.

**`src/config/redis.js`**: This file (12:51:11 PM) configures a Redis client, connecting to a Redis Cloud instance using credentials from environment variables.

**`src/middleware/adminMiddleware.js` and `src/middleware/userMiddleware.js`**: These files (12:52:20 PM and 12:52:39 PM respectively) implement middleware for authentication and authorization using JWTs and Redis for token blacklisting. The `adminMiddleware` additionally checks for the user's role before granting access.

**`src/routes/problemCreator.js`**: This file (12:53:38 PM) defines routes for managing problems, including creating, updating, deleting, and fetching problems.

There's a clear evolution of the project. The initial commit sets up the basic structure and database connection. Subsequent commits added user authentication and authorization features, including password hashing, JWT generation, and token management via Redis.  Finally, routes for problem management were defined. The use of Redis suggests a focus on performance and scalability.


## 1:24:29 PM
The log shows development of user authentication and a problem-solving model.

On August 26th, 2025,  `userAuthent.js` (controllers) was updated twice within a short timeframe (12:40 PM).  These updates appear to be minor and didn't change the functionality of user registration and login significantly.  The code implements user registration and login using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication.  A `logout` function is included but is currently empty.  Both `register` and `login` functions handle errors and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes.

At 12:41 PM, `userAuth.js` (routes) was updated to define routes for user registration, login, logout, and getProfile (the latter's implementation is not shown).

A `validator.js` (utils) file was added at 12:42 PM to validate user input data ensuring that mandatory fields (`firstName`, `emailId`, `password`) are present and that the email and password meet certain criteria (using the validator library).

Finally, at 12:53 PM, a `problem.js` (models) file was created, defining a Mongoose schema for a `Problem` model. This model is rich, including fields for title, description, difficulty, tags, visible and hidden test cases, start code in various languages, reference solutions, and a reference to the problem creator (user).  This suggests development of a platform where users can create and solve coding problems.


## 10:57:19 PM
The log shows significant updates to the backend of a Codenopsis application, primarily focused on problem creation, updates, deletion, retrieval, and user submission functionalities.

On August 26th, 2025, at 10:47:41 PM, `userProblem.js` was updated to include comprehensive CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for problems.  The `createProblem` and `updateProblem` functions incorporate functionality to test reference solutions using a Judge0 API (`submitBatch` and `submitToken`).  Error handling is implemented throughout the controller.  Additionally, functions for retrieving problems by ID, retrieving all problems, getting solved problems by a user, and retrieving submitted problems by a user and problem ID are included.

A subsequent update to `userProblem.js` at 10:47:52 PM refactored the code related to batch submission, clarifying variable names and commenting. The commented-out example suggests the previous iteration directly used the output from the visible test cases without much validation.


At 10:49:08 PM, `problemUtility.js` was modified.  The `submitBatch` function, responsible for sending problem solutions to the Judge0 API, was updated. Notably, the `base64_encoded` parameter in the API request was changed from `true` to `false` in the later version (10:53:43 PM).  The critical update at 10:53:43 PM adds a `submitToken` function for retrieving results from Judge0, along with a `waiting` function for polling the API.  The API key (`x-rapidapi-key`) is now dynamically fetched from the environment variable `process.env.JUDGE0_KEY`.

The `package-lock.json` (10:49:30 PM) and `package.json` (10:49:38 PM) files reflect the project's dependencies, indicating use of various packages including `axios`, `bcrypt`, `express`, `mongoose`, and `redis`. No changes were made to the dependencies themselves between these two timestamps.

The `.env` file (10:52:59 PM) contains sensitive information (database connection string, JWT key, Judge0 API key) and has been omitted from the summary per the provided instruction.
