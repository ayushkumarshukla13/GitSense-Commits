# Activity Summary for 8/26/2025

## 9:40:19 AM
The log shows the evolution of the `Concert_Tickets.cpp` file over a period of approximately one hour, from August 25th, 11:57 PM to August 26th, 12:17 AM.  The initial commits contained commented-out code related to sieve methods (likely for prime number generation or divisor calculation), and various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations).  These were seemingly unused and were not part of the main logic.

Between 11:57 PM and 11:59 PM on August 25th, a significant change occurred: the `CutiePie` function was fleshed out to read integers into a vector.  Subsequent commits (August 26th, 12:00 AM - 12:04 AM) refined `CutiePie` further.  The function now takes two integers as input (n and m), reads n integers into vector 'a' and m integers into vector 'b', creates a vector 'c' and sorts 'a'. The logic attempted to iterate through 'b', finding the largest element in 'a' less than or equal to the current element in 'b'. It then intended to output this found element and remove it from 'a' using `a.erase(qt)`, which had a few syntax errors that were gradually corrected.  There were also issues with the handling of cases where no suitable element exists in 'a', which was resolved by checking if `qt` is equal to `a.begin()` in later commits.

Finally, between 12:09 AM and 12:17 AM on August 26th, the code underwent a major restructuring.  The `a` vector was replaced by a `multiset` to enable efficient searching and removal of elements. The solution uses `upper_bound` to find the largest element less than or equal to the query element. This is a much cleaner and more efficient approach than the previous attempts. The commented-out mathematical functions were removed in the final commit.  The final code is a concise and efficient solution to the concert ticket problem, utilizing standard library functions like `multiset` and `upper_bound` for optimal performance.
