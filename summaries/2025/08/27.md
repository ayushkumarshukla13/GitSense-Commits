# Activity Summary for 8/27/2025

## 12:09:11 AM
The file `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Rohit\Day08\src\utils\validator.js` was updated on August 26, 2025, at 11:31:27 PM.  This update introduced a `validate` function that checks for the presence of mandatory fields ('firstName', 'emailId', 'password') in an input data object.  It uses the `validator` library to verify that the email is valid and the password meets strength requirements. If any of these checks fail, it throws an appropriate error.  The function is then exported for use elsewhere.

The codebase underwent significant changes between 11:17 PM and 11:40 PM on August 26, 2025.  The primary focus was on enhancing the backend functionalities for user authentication, problem creation/management, and code submission/judgement.

**`submission.js` (models):**  This model was updated to include `testCasesTotal` field and added an index to optimize queries involving userId and problemId.  The language enum was also updated to include 'c++'.

**`userSubmission.js` (controllers):** This controller was extensively modified to handle code submission (`submitCode`) and  add a new route to run code against visible test cases (`runCode`). The `submitCode` function now updates the submission record with detailed results from a batch submission to Judge0, including runtime, memory usage, and status.  It also updates the user's `problemSolved` array upon successful submission. The response format changed to JSON.

**`submit.js` (routes):** This file added a new route `/run/:id` to handle the `runCode` functionality.

**`userAuthent.js` (controllers):** This controller saw the addition of a `deleteProfile` function to allow users to delete their profiles and the related submissions.

**`userProblem.js` (controllers):**  This controller was enhanced with new endpoints and functionalities: creating, updating, deleting, retrieving individual and all problems. It now also handles checking submitted solutions against visible test cases during problem creation and update. A new endpoint `submittedProblem` was added to retrieve a user's submissions for a given problem.  The `createProblem` and `updateProblem` functions now use batch submissions to Judge0 to validate reference solutions against visible test cases.

**`adminMiddleware.js` and `userMiddleware.js` (middleware):** These middleware functions are very similar, both implementing JWT authentication and checking against a Redis blacklist for blocked tokens. `adminMiddleware` additionally verifies the user's role as 'admin'.

**`problem.js` (models):** This model remains largely unchanged, defining the structure for problem data, including test cases, start code, and reference solutions.

**`user.js` (models):** This model was updated to include a post-delete hook that removes associated submissions when a user is deleted.

**`problemCreator.js` (routes):** This file added a new route `/submittedProblem/:pid` to handle the newly added `submittedProblem` endpoint in `userProblem.js`.

**`validator.js` (utils):** This utility function remains unchanged for data validation.

**`index.js` (main):** This file initializes the database connection and the server. No significant changes were made.

**`package.json` and `package-lock.json`:** These files were updated to reflect the addition of new packages and their dependencies throughout the codebase.  There are no noteworthy changes in the dependencies themselves.


In summary, the changes demonstrate a significant expansion of the application's functionality, focusing on a robust system for problem creation, code submission, and user management, leveraging Judge0 for code execution and Redis for token management.  The multiple updates to the `userProblem.js` and `userSubmission.js` controllers highlight a consistent effort to improve the code's efficiency and reliability.  The addition of the deleteProfile and the post-delete hook in the user model enhances data integrity.
