# Activity Summary for 8/27/2025

## 12:09:11 AM
The file `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Rohit\Day08\src\utils\validator.js` was updated on August 26, 2025, at 11:31:27 PM.  This update introduced a `validate` function that checks for the presence of mandatory fields ('firstName', 'emailId', 'password') in an input data object.  It uses the `validator` library to verify that the email is valid and the password meets strength requirements. If any of these checks fail, it throws an appropriate error.  The function is then exported for use elsewhere.
