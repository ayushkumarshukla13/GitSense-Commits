# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 11:26:14 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`C_Simple_Strings.cpp`) over several minutes on August 8th, 2025.  The initial code contained commented-out code for various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr) and sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers.  These functions were never used in the main logic.

The core functionality of the program focused on processing a single input string (`s`). The changes tracked iterative development of the `CutiePie` function.  Initially, the function simply read the input string. Subsequent edits added the functionality to:

1. **Calculate string length:**  Determining the size of the input string (`s.size()`).
2. **Create a character vector:** Initializing an empty character vector `ans`.
3. **Process the string:** Iterating through the input string, appending characters to `ans`. The logic in this loop underwent several revisions.

The most significant changes occurred between **10:26 PM and 10:47 PM**. During this period, the core algorithm within the loop in `CutiePie`  was refined. The goal was to create a new string `ans` where consecutive identical characters in the original input string `s` are separated by another character ('a' to 'z'), avoiding repeating the character immediately before it or the character immediately after it (if present).

The final version, achieved around **10:52 PM**, efficiently appends a different character whenever consecutive characters are identical. The output is then printed to the console.  The commented-out sieve and mathematical functions remained unused throughout the development process.
