# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 9:00:36 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `A_Homework.cpp` and `B_The_Secret_Number.cpp`.

`A_Homework.cpp` underwent several revisions between 8:06 PM and 8:10 PM on August 21, 2025.  Initially, the `CutiePie` function was incomplete.  Subsequent changes added input of two strings (`a` and `b`) and an integer (`m`). The final version of `CutiePie` iterates through string `b`, conditionally appending characters to string `a` based on whether the index is even or odd.  Odd indices trigger a reversal of `a` before appending and another reversal afterward.  A third input string `c` was added and its characters determined whether to append directly or with reversal.

`B_The_Secret_Number.cpp` was modified between 8:11 PM and 9:00 PM on August 21, 2025.  The file started with an empty `CutiePie` function.  Significant changes occurred between 8:48 PM and 9:00 PM. A `binpow` function (binary exponentiation) was added. The `CutiePie` function was then developed to find numbers obtained by dividing the input `n` by (1 + 10<sup>i</sup>) where `i` ranges from 1 to 18, if the division results in a whole number. These results are stored, and the code outputs the count of these numbers and the numbers themselves, sorted.  The `MOD` define was eventually removed, and the `binpow` function was simplified.  A special case was added to handle the case where no such number is found.


## 10:00:37 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program, `C_1_The_Cunning_Seller_easy_version.cpp`, over a short period (approximately 10 minutes).  The initial version (9:11:08 PM) calculates the cost of a deal based on a formula involving powers of 3.  It precomputes powers of 3 and their costs for optimization.

Subsequent changes (starting 9:13:17 PM) significantly restructured the code.  Large blocks of commented-out code related to sieve, calculating divisors, factorials, powers, modular inverse, and nCr were added, suggesting the exploration of various algorithms or mathematical functions initially, then removed.

The core logic shifted towards a function `CutiePie`, initially empty, which progressively developed to handle input, create vectors (`v` and `v1`), and compute a final answer. There were several incomplete statements and syntax errors within  `CutiePie` during these intermediate commits (9:13:30 PM, 9:13:39 PM, 9:13:59 PM, 9:14:11 PM, 9:14:40 PM, 9:14:56 PM).  The `funny` function,  which calculates the cost (similar to `dealCost` in the initial version), underwent modifications, including type casting and refinement  (9:15:16 PM, 9:15:23 PM, 9:15:46 PM, 9:15:54 PM, 9:16:04 PM, 9:16:34 PM, 9:16:42 PM, 9:16:52 PM).

The final, functional version (9:19:32 PM)  uses `funny` to pre-compute costs and implements a base-3 conversion algorithm to solve the main problem within the `CutiePie` function, correctly calculating and printing the final answer. The commented-out code sections remained throughout the entire editing process.  The evolution reveals a process of iterative refinement and debugging, with the commented code possibly representing explorations of alternative approaches.
