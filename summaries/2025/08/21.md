# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 9:00:36 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `A_Homework.cpp` and `B_The_Secret_Number.cpp`.

`A_Homework.cpp` underwent several revisions between 8:06 PM and 8:10 PM on August 21, 2025.  Initially, the `CutiePie` function was incomplete.  Subsequent changes added input of two strings (`a` and `b`) and an integer (`m`). The final version of `CutiePie` iterates through string `b`, conditionally appending characters to string `a` based on whether the index is even or odd.  Odd indices trigger a reversal of `a` before appending and another reversal afterward.  A third input string `c` was added and its characters determined whether to append directly or with reversal.

`B_The_Secret_Number.cpp` was modified between 8:11 PM and 9:00 PM on August 21, 2025.  The file started with an empty `CutiePie` function.  Significant changes occurred between 8:48 PM and 9:00 PM. A `binpow` function (binary exponentiation) was added. The `CutiePie` function was then developed to find numbers obtained by dividing the input `n` by (1 + 10<sup>i</sup>) where `i` ranges from 1 to 18, if the division results in a whole number. These results are stored, and the code outputs the count of these numbers and the numbers themselves, sorted.  The `MOD` define was eventually removed, and the `binpow` function was simplified.  A special case was added to handle the case where no such number is found.
