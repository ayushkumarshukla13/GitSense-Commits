# Activity Summary for 8/19/2025

## 10:09:03 PM
The log shows iterative development of a C++ program (`D_Jumping_Through_Segments.cpp`) that appears to solve a problem involving segments.  The initial commit (8/19/2025, 9:08:56 PM) contains a skeletal structure with commented-out code for various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr).  The subsequent commits focus on refining the `CutiePie()` function.

Between 8/19/2025, 9:10:25 PM and 8/19/2025, 9:11:56 PM, the code within `CutiePie()` is progressively developed to read input: an integer `n` representing the number of segments, and then a vector of `n` pairs of integers (`vector<pair<int, int>> v(n)`), presumably representing the start and end points of each segment.

The major development happens between 8/19/2025, 9:11:56 PM and 9:20:27 PM.  A binary search (`while(lo <= hi)`) is introduced within `CutiePie()`, using a `ck()` function (initially incomplete) to perform a check on `mid`.  The `ck()` function undergoes several revisions, evolving from an empty function to one that iterates over the segments. The objective of `ck()` seems to be determining whether a certain condition is met for a given `mid` value. The program's logic appears to be based around finding an optimal value using binary search.

Finally, by 8/19/2025, 9:55:39 PM, `ck()` appears complete and uses a binary search approach for some segment condition.  The commented-out code remains throughout the development. The final version prints the result (`hi + 1`).  The overall development pattern shows a clear focus on refining the core algorithm through incremental changes to the `ck()` and `CutiePie()` functions and  using binary search to efficiently solve a problem involving segments.  The commented code hints at a possible broader context for the program that might involve number theory or combinatorics, which is not actively used in the final version.
