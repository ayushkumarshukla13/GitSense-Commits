# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 1:11:56 PM
The log shows the development of a C++ solution for a problem named "A_Strange_Birthday_Party".  The file `C_Make_it_Equal.cpp` is present in the log but its content is not shown. The primary focus is on `A_Strange_Birthday_Party.cpp`, which undergoes significant iterative changes between 12:11 PM and 12:15 PM on August 12th, 2025.

Initially, the code includes commented-out sections related to sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and combinations. These are likely helper functions that were considered but later removed or unused in the final solution.

The core logic within the `CutiePie` function evolves over several commits:

1. **12:11:59 PM:** The `CutiePie` function is empty.
2. **12:12:04 PM:**  `n` is declared, but input is incomplete.
3. **12:12:12 PM:** Input for `n` and `m` is added.
4. **12:12:50 PM:** A vector `k` is introduced and initialized, with an incomplete input loop inside.
5. **12:12:57 PM:** The input loop for `k` is made more complete by adding `int x; cin >> x`.
6. **12:13:08 PM:** A vector `c` is added, but the loop is incomplete.
7. **12:13:15 PM:** The loop for `c` is completed, with `int x; cin >> x; c.push_back(x);`.  However, the loop is still missing a crucial part.
8. **12:13:37 PM:** `k` is sorted and `ans` is initialized.
9. **12:13:43 PM:** `p` is initialized.
10. **12:13:52 PM:** The core algorithm starts to take shape within the `for` loop that iterates through `k` in reverse order.
11. **12:14:04 PM:** The `for` loop is completed, though the loop body remains empty.
12. **12:14:49 PM:** The condition `if(p<m && c[p]<=c[])` within the loop suggests an attempt to compare elements, but it is incomplete.
13. **12:15:08 PM:** The algorithm is finalized: it iterates through sorted `k`, comparing elements of `c` and accumulating `ans` based on the comparison.
14. **12:15:34 PM:** The final version includes the `cout << ans << endl;` statement.


The progression shows a clear pattern of iterative refinement, with the algorithm for solving "A_Strange_Birthday_Party" being developed step by step, adding variables, input, and logic incrementally.  The frequent commits indicate a dynamic coding process.
