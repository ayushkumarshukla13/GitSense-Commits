# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 1:11:56 PM
The log shows the development of a C++ solution for a problem named "A_Strange_Birthday_Party".  The file `C_Make_it_Equal.cpp` is present in the log but its content is not shown. The primary focus is on `A_Strange_Birthday_Party.cpp`, which undergoes significant iterative changes between 12:11 PM and 12:15 PM on August 12th, 2025.

Initially, the code includes commented-out sections related to sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and combinations. These are likely helper functions that were considered but later removed or unused in the final solution.

The core logic within the `CutiePie` function evolves over several commits:

1. **12:11:59 PM:** The `CutiePie` function is empty.
2. **12:12:04 PM:**  `n` is declared, but input is incomplete.
3. **12:12:12 PM:** Input for `n` and `m` is added.
4. **12:12:50 PM:** A vector `k` is introduced and initialized, with an incomplete input loop inside.
5. **12:12:57 PM:** The input loop for `k` is made more complete by adding `int x; cin >> x`.
6. **12:13:08 PM:** A vector `c` is added, but the loop is incomplete.
7. **12:13:15 PM:** The loop for `c` is completed, with `int x; cin >> x; c.push_back(x);`.  However, the loop is still missing a crucial part.
8. **12:13:37 PM:** `k` is sorted and `ans` is initialized.
9. **12:13:43 PM:** `p` is initialized.
10. **12:13:52 PM:** The core algorithm starts to take shape within the `for` loop that iterates through `k` in reverse order.
11. **12:14:04 PM:** The `for` loop is completed, though the loop body remains empty.
12. **12:14:49 PM:** The condition `if(p<m && c[p]<=c[])` within the loop suggests an attempt to compare elements, but it is incomplete.
13. **12:15:08 PM:** The algorithm is finalized: it iterates through sorted `k`, comparing elements of `c` and accumulating `ans` based on the comparison.
14. **12:15:34 PM:** The final version includes the `cout << ans << endl;` statement.


The progression shows a clear pattern of iterative refinement, with the algorithm for solving "A_Strange_Birthday_Party" being developed step by step, adding variables, input, and logic incrementally.  The frequent commits indicate a dynamic coding process.


## 2:11:54 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program (`B_Box_Fitting.cpp`).  The initial version (8/12/2025, 1:22:42 PM) contains a basic structure with commented-out code for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions.  These functions suggest an intention to potentially incorporate number theory or combinatorics later.

Between 1:23:10 PM and 1:25:17 PM, the `CutiePie` function is progressively developed.  It begins by reading input values `n` and `m`, and a vector `k` of size `n`. A `multiset` named `s` is introduced to store elements from `k`.  The code then attempts to implement a logic involving `l`, `h` and `s`, appearing to be some sort of iterative algorithm (possibly a binary search or two pointer approach)  that uses the `multiset` `s` and values `l` and `h`. The code undergoes many small changes until it is refined to use `upper_bound` on the multiset.  There's a lot of experimentation apparent in the incremental changes during this time.

Between 1:25:17 PM and 1:27:44 PM, the `CutiePie` function is further refined.  The core logic within the `while` loop is improved to correctly use the `upper_bound` function of the multiset and perform operations on the selected element of the multiset (`id`).  The code becomes more structured and readable in this phase.


Finally, at 1:28:02 PM and 1:28:13 PM, the output of the function (`h`) is added using `cout`. Minor syntax fixes (like correcting the `s.erase()` operation at 1:29:42 PM)  and a correction in the condition of while loop (at 1:33:51 PM)  are made until the final version is completed at 1:34:18 PM.  The final code utilizes a `multiset` to efficiently manage and process the input data within the algorithm designed in the `CutiePie` function.  The commented-out code at the beginning remains untouched throughout the entire process.


## 3:11:52 PM
The log shows a single code file, `B_Box_Fitting.cpp`, updated on August 12, 2025, at 2:56:36 PM.  The code implements a solution to a problem involving fitting boxes (likely a variant of bin packing).  The core logic resides in the `CutiePie()` function, which uses a `multiset` to manage box sizes and iteratively places them until all boxes are assigned. The algorithm appears to prioritize larger boxes, attempting to place them before smaller ones.  The main function handles multiple test cases.  The commented-out sections suggest previous implementations or attempts involving sieve of Eratosthenes (for primality testing), calculation of divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse and combinations (nCr) functions, which were ultimately not used in the final submitted version.  The final algorithm is more efficient using a multiset and a greedy approach to box fitting.
