# Activity Summary for 8/25/2025

## 1:08:56 AM
The log shows development across two files, `Number_Spiral.cpp` and `Two_Knights.cpp`, with a final, incomplete attempt at `Two_Sets.cpp`.

**Number_Spiral.cpp:**  This file underwent significant changes between 12:09 AM and 12:17 AM. Initially, the code contained commented-out sections related to sieving, calculating divisors, and various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr).  The core logic was progressively developed within the `CutiePie` function, which started as an empty function and evolved to read input (n, a, b) and calculate a result based on whether 'b' is even or odd, using the formula (b*b)-a or (a*a)-(b-1) respectively.  The final version of the function processes multiple test cases.  A complete rewrite of the solution occurred around 12:15 AM, replacing the iterative approach with a more concise function `NumberSpiral` that directly calculates the answer based on the input coordinates.  The main function also changed to handle multiple input pairs.

**Two_Knights.cpp:** Development happened between 12:46 AM and 12:49 AM.  Similar to `Number_Spiral.cpp`, this file also began with commented-out code for various mathematical functions. The `CutiePie` function was incrementally developed to solve the problem of calculating the number of ways to place two knights on an NxN chessboard such that they don't attack each other. The solution involved calculating total possible positions, subtracting positions where knights attack each other, and then dividing by 2 to handle duplicate counting. The logic was refined to handle the base cases (n=1, n=2) separately, leading to the final correct implementation.

**Two_Sets.cpp:** This file shows an initial structure similar to the other two, including commented-out code.  However, the development is incomplete, with attempts at determining whether a number can be partitioned into two sets with equal sums. The final code snippet shows a partially implemented solution that checks for even numbers and whether half the number is even as well.  The code lacks a fully functional implementation of set partitioning.
