# Activity Summary for 8/25/2025

## 1:08:56 AM
The log shows development across two files, `Number_Spiral.cpp` and `Two_Knights.cpp`, with a final, incomplete attempt at `Two_Sets.cpp`.

**Number_Spiral.cpp:**  This file underwent significant changes between 12:09 AM and 12:17 AM. Initially, the code contained commented-out sections related to sieving, calculating divisors, and various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr).  The core logic was progressively developed within the `CutiePie` function, which started as an empty function and evolved to read input (n, a, b) and calculate a result based on whether 'b' is even or odd, using the formula (b*b)-a or (a*a)-(b-1) respectively.  The final version of the function processes multiple test cases.  A complete rewrite of the solution occurred around 12:15 AM, replacing the iterative approach with a more concise function `NumberSpiral` that directly calculates the answer based on the input coordinates.  The main function also changed to handle multiple input pairs.

**Two_Knights.cpp:** Development happened between 12:46 AM and 12:49 AM.  Similar to `Number_Spiral.cpp`, this file also began with commented-out code for various mathematical functions. The `CutiePie` function was incrementally developed to solve the problem of calculating the number of ways to place two knights on an NxN chessboard such that they don't attack each other. The solution involved calculating total possible positions, subtracting positions where knights attack each other, and then dividing by 2 to handle duplicate counting. The logic was refined to handle the base cases (n=1, n=2) separately, leading to the final correct implementation.

**Two_Sets.cpp:** This file shows an initial structure similar to the other two, including commented-out code.  However, the development is incomplete, with attempts at determining whether a number can be partitioned into two sets with equal sums. The final code snippet shows a partially implemented solution that checks for even numbers and whether half the number is even as well.  The code lacks a fully functional implementation of set partitioning.


## 2:08:53 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`Two_Sets.cpp`) between 1:09 AM and 1:11 AM on August 25, 2025.  The core functionality involves checking if a given number `n` can be partitioned into two sets with equal sums.

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr.  These were likely explored or considered but ultimately not used in the final version.

The `CutiePie` function underwent several revisions.  Early versions had incomplete or incorrect logic for handling the output of two vectors (`a` and `b`) representing the partition.  Between 1:09:34 AM and 1:10:26 AM, the code was refined to correctly populate and print these vectors, representing the two sets of numbers which sum to `n/2`.  A significant change at 1:10:26 AM involved moving the vector initialization outside the `else` block for better code organization and handling the case where `n` is odd. Finally, by 1:11:11 AM the odd number case was properly handled by only printing "NO" when `n` is odd, otherwise proceeding with the partitioning logic.  The final code efficiently checks for even numbers and then for the divisibility of n/2 by 2, indicating whether a solution is possible. The program then prints the size and elements of the two partitions.  The commented-out code suggests exploration of various mathematical functions and algorithms during development, though none were ultimately used in the final, concise partition checking and printing.


## 10:02:41 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`Two_Sets.cpp`) designed to solve a problem related to partitioning a number into two sets.  The main changes occur within the `CutiePie` function.

Initially (8/25/2025, 9:46:23 AM), the `CutiePie` function was empty.  Subsequent edits progressively added functionality:

* **9:46:31 AM:**  The function now takes an integer input `n`.
* **9:46:41 AM:**  A check is introduced: If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" and returns, implying that an odd number cannot be partitioned into two sets with equal sums.
* **9:46:49 AM:** The code adds an `else` block after the odd number check, leaving it empty for future development.
* **9:47:44 AM:**  The `else` block now checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If so, it prints "YES". This suggests the program might be checking for a condition where a solution exists for even numbers divisible by 4.
* **9:48:26 AM:**  A minor structural change within the `else if` condition improves code readability.
* **9:50:05 AM - 9:50:51 AM:** Further refinements are made to the `else if` statement to handle cases where `n` is not divisible by 4.  Vectors `a` and `b` are introduced, likely to store the partitions.
* **9:59:20 AM - 10:02:11 AM:** A significant change is introduced. A special case for `n == 3` is added, printing "YES" and seemingly outputting two sets. The code then attempts to build the partitioning logic for even numbers, particularly those divisible by 4, using vectors `a` and `b`, but it is incomplete.  The logic for numbers divisible by 4 remains unfinished at the end of the log.


Throughout the log, there are commented-out sections of code related to sieves, calculating divisors, factorial, power, and modular inverse calculations. These were likely explored early in development but were deemed unnecessary for the final solution, possibly indicating an initial approach using number theory which was later abandoned in favor of a simpler approach focusing on divisibility.  The program's structure remained consistent, utilizing a `main` function that reads the number of test cases and iteratively calls `CutiePie`.


## 12:16:55 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `Two_Sets.cpp` and `Gray_Code.cpp`.

**Two_Sets.cpp:** This file underwent significant changes between 10:08 AM and 10:14 AM, primarily focusing on improving the algorithm's logic and output formatting.  Initially, the code had issues with loop boundaries (starting from 0 instead of 1), duplicate variable declarations (`z`), and incomplete output. The algorithm itself was refined to correctly identify and handle cases where a partition into two sets with equal sums is not possible and also to handle the case when n=3. The final version (10:14 AM onwards) uses a more efficient and clearer approach to partition the numbers into two sets, improving both readability and correctness. The commented-out code suggests explorations of other mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) that were ultimately not incorporated into the final solution.

**Gray_Code.cpp:** This file's development spanned from 10:47 AM to 11:43 AM. The initial commits show an incomplete `CutiePie` function. The function was gradually built, incorporating a `printBinaryN` function to print binary representations of numbers.  There was a brief attempt to utilize a `binpow` function (binary exponentiation), but it was eventually removed.  The main challenge seemed to be generating Gray code, and the final version (11:43 AM) demonstrates a functional iterative algorithm to generate the Gray code of length n.  The algorithm efficiently creates the Gray code using string manipulation, avoiding the use of other complex mathematical operations.
