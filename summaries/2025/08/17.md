# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 1:45:16 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`B_Just_Eat_It.cpp`) between 12:45 AM and 12:47 AM on August 17, 2025.  The code implements a solution to a problem where it reads integers from input and determines a condition based on their sum and a calculated maximum value.

Initially, the `CutiePie` function only calculated the sum of input integers.  Subsequent changes added functionality to compute a maximum value (`maxi`) based on a running sum (`bhak`) that resets to 0 if it becomes negative. This running sum considers subarrays starting from index 1 and then from index 0.  The program's logic then checks if the total sum (`sum`) is greater than this computed `maxi`. The final version prints "YES" if the condition `sum > maxi` holds, and "NO" otherwise.  The commented-out sections suggest the initial code potentially included functionalities for sieving primes, calculating divisors, and combinatorial functions, but these were ultimately removed or unused in the final implementation.  The numerous small changes between 12:45 and 12:47 AM reflect the iterative development and debugging process.  There is a recurring pattern of adding and refining the calculation of `maxi` in the `CutiePie` function.
