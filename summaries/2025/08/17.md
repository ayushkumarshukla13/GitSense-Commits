# Activity Summary for 8/17/2025

## 1:45:16 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`B_Just_Eat_It.cpp`) between 12:45 AM and 12:47 AM on August 17, 2025.  The code implements a solution to a problem where it reads integers from input and determines a condition based on their sum and a calculated maximum value.

Initially, the `CutiePie` function only calculated the sum of input integers.  Subsequent changes added functionality to compute a maximum value (`maxi`) based on a running sum (`bhak`) that resets to 0 if it becomes negative. This running sum considers subarrays starting from index 1 and then from index 0.  The program's logic then checks if the total sum (`sum`) is greater than this computed `maxi`. The final version prints "YES" if the condition `sum > maxi` holds, and "NO" otherwise.  The commented-out sections suggest the initial code potentially included functionalities for sieving primes, calculating divisors, and combinatorial functions, but these were ultimately removed or unused in the final implementation.  The numerous small changes between 12:45 and 12:47 AM reflect the iterative development and debugging process.  There is a recurring pattern of adding and refining the calculation of `maxi` in the `CutiePie` function.


## 10:50:26 AM
The log shows the development of a C++ solution for a problem named "B_Balanced_Tunnel."  The file `B_Balanced_Tunnel.cpp` underwent several revisions between 10:25 AM and 10:31 AM on August 17, 2025.

Initially, the code was incomplete, with a `for` loop in the `CutiePie` function left unfinished.  Subsequent revisions progressively added more code to this function.  The core logic involves taking two input vectors (`a` and `b`), creating a map (`mp`) to store the indices of elements in `a`, and then using this map to create a new vector `c` which represents a permutation of indices based on the elements of `b`. Finally, the code calculates `ans`, representing a count based on comparing elements in `c`.  The final version correctly calculates and prints this `ans`.  Several commented-out sections of code related to sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, and modular inverse functions were present throughout the revisions but remained unchanged, suggesting they were possibly considered for later use or were remnants from earlier iterations of the code.  The `main` function remains largely unchanged throughout, simply calling the `CutiePie` function repeatedly.  There is no change to the `Just_Eat_It.cpp` file.  The final working code efficiently determines and prints the value of 'ans' based on the input vectors.
