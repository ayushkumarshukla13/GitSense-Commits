The log shows a single code file, `C_Make_it_Equal.cpp`, updated on August 10, 2025, at 10:23:21 PM.  The code implements a function `CutiePie` that checks if two arrays `a` and `b` can be made equal by applying modulo k operation to their elements.

The function first handles the base case where k is 0, then checks if the counts of elements congruent modulo k are equal for each residue class.  It uses an unordered map to efficiently count these. A significant portion of the code (commented out) appears to be related to sieve methods, calculating divisors, factorials, powers, modular inverses, and combinations; these are not used in the main logic of `CutiePie`. The `main` function handles multiple test cases.  The core logic focuses on efficient modulo arithmetic and frequency counting to determine array equality under specific conditions.
