# Activity Summary for 8/16/2025

## 10:25:22 AM
The log shows edits to `D_Buying_Shovels.cpp` between 9:25 AM and 9:27 AM on August 16, 2025.  The file contains a C++ solution to a problem (likely a coding challenge). The code includes commented-out sections suggesting the exploration of various algorithms (sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr).  The core logic is in the `CutiePie` function, which finds the smallest divisor of 'a' that is less than or equal to 'b'.

Initially, the loop in `CutiePie` iterated up to an unspecified limit (`i<;i`).  Subsequent changes optimized this loop by limiting the iterations to the minimum of 'b' and the square root of 'a' (`int qt=min(b,sqrt(a))`, later improved to  `int qt=min(b,1LL*sqrt(a))` and then `int qt = min(b, static_cast<long long>(sqrt(a)))` to ensure correct type casting).  Further refinements involved initializing a variable 'z' to 'a' to find the minimum divisor and modifying the conditional checks within the loop to correctly identify and update the minimum divisor ('z'). The final version of the code efficiently finds the required divisor.  There are no recurring elements besides the commented-out code sections.


## 11:25:31 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`C_Product_of_Three_Numbers.cpp`) designed to determine if a number has at least three divisors.  The file underwent significant changes between 10:50 AM and 11:24 AM on August 16, 2025.

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculation, and various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr).  These were likely placeholders or explorations of different approaches, ultimately unused in the final version.

The core logic development focused on the `CutiePie()` function.  It started as an empty function and progressively evolved:

1. **10:59 AM:**  The function began reading an integer input (`n`) and calculating its divisors, storing them in a vector `v`.
2. **10:59 AM - 11:00 AM:** The approach to storing divisors and the vector's size were refined.  There were several incomplete code iterations within this period.
3. **11:00 AM - 11:02 AM:** The code improved to count the number of divisors (`ct`) and check if `ct` is greater than or equal to 3.  The program began outputting "YES" if the condition was met, otherwise it remained silent.
4. **11:02 AM - 11:14 AM:** More refinements in how to handle the output if the condition was met or not were added; there were multiple unfinished attempts to print certain divisors.
5. **11:14 AM:** The divisor-finding and counting logic was entirely commented out.
6. **11:14 AM - 11:18 AM:** A new `printDivisors` function was introduced and then replaced with `Div`, designed to find the divisors of a number. The `CutiePie` function now utilized this function and provided an output based on the number of divisors.
7. **11:18 AM - 11:24 AM:** Further refinement of the logic and output formatting continued. The final code efficiently finds divisors up to the square root of the input, avoids duplicates, and outputs "YES" along with the first three divisors if the condition is met. If the condition is not met, it outputs "NO". The commented-out code was removed in the final version.


The `main` function remained relatively unchanged throughout, primarily focusing on reading the number of test cases.  The final code is concise and efficient in determining if a number has at least three divisors.  The commented-out code suggests an iterative development process with exploration of various algorithms before settling on a more optimized solution.
