# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 12:20:56 AM
The log shows modifications to the `D_Divide_and_Equalize.cpp` file between 12:02:37 AM and 12:03:13 AM on August 6, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, the `CutiePie()` function was incomplete, only declaring an integer `n` and a vector `v`.  Subsequent edits progressively added functionality.  By 12:02:56 AM, a loop to populate the vector `v` with `n` integer inputs was started, but was incomplete. At 12:03:03 AM, the input reading inside the loop was corrected to `cin >> x;`. Finally, by 12:03:13 AM,  the loop was completed by adding `v.push_back(x);` to store the inputs in the vector.

The commented-out code sections at the beginning of the file remain unchanged throughout the log and appear to be commented-out implementations for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculation and common mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr).  These were not modified during this period of edits.  The main function remains largely consistent, indicating that the focus of the changes was specifically on the `CutiePie()` function.
