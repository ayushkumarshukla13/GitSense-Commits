# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 12:20:56 AM
The log shows modifications to the `D_Divide_and_Equalize.cpp` file between 12:02:37 AM and 12:03:13 AM on August 6, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, the `CutiePie()` function was incomplete, only declaring an integer `n` and a vector `v`.  Subsequent edits progressively added functionality.  By 12:02:56 AM, a loop to populate the vector `v` with `n` integer inputs was started, but was incomplete. At 12:03:03 AM, the input reading inside the loop was corrected to `cin >> x;`. Finally, by 12:03:13 AM,  the loop was completed by adding `v.push_back(x);` to store the inputs in the vector.

The commented-out code sections at the beginning of the file remain unchanged throughout the log and appear to be commented-out implementations for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculation and common mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr).  These were not modified during this period of edits.  The main function remains largely consistent, indicating that the focus of the changes was specifically on the `CutiePie()` function.


## 4:10:47 PM
The file `C:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\C_Make_it_Alternating.cpp` underwent several modifications on August 6, 2025.  The main changes focused on the `CutiePie()` function within the code.

Initially, at 3:10:51 PM, `CutiePie()` was an empty function.  At 3:11:00 PM, a `string s;` declaration was added inside `CutiePie()`.  At 3:11:07 PM, the function was further updated to read a string from standard input using `cin >> s;`.  A minor change at 3:11:14 PM removed the line `cin >> qt;`,  effectively making the program always execute `CutiePie()` once regardless of user input. Finally, at 4:04:39 PM, the `CutiePie()` function was reverted to its initial empty state.

Throughout these changes,  commented-out code blocks remained consistently present, suggesting potential helper functions (factorial, power, modInverse, nCr, sieve, and divisor calculation) that were not utilized in the final version.  The commented code suggests the exploration of various mathematical functions that were ultimately not necessary for the implemented solution.  The rapid succession of changes between 3:11:00 PM and 3:11:14 PM indicates a period of active development and testing, potentially related to input handling and program logic.


## 5:10:51 PM
The log shows the evolution of the `C_Make_it_Alternating.cpp` file over a short period.  Initially (8/6/2025, 4:13:39 PM and 4:13:44 PM), the code contained commented-out snippets for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions.  The `CutiePie` function was a stub, simply reading a string and storing its size.

Between 4:13 PM and 4:35 PM, the `CutiePie` function underwent significant changes.  A `vector<int>` `v` was added, initially with the aim of storing elements from the input string `s`. The code iteratively added elements to `v` if they differed from the last element in `v`. This suggests the logic is building a subsequence of unique characters.  Several incomplete or erroneous attempts to build this subsequence  are evident in the timestamps between 4:34:21 PM and 4:35:00 PM.  Finally (4:35:00 PM), a functional subsequence was created using a `vector<char>`

Further modifications (4:35:00 PM onwards) involved adding a counter `ct` and the variable `ans`, intended to calculate a final result.  The calculation of `ans` involves multiplying `ct` values, this may be a step towards counting a specific type of subsequence.  The `MOD` constant changed from 1000000007 to 998244353, suggesting a switch to a different modulus for modular arithmetic.  By 4:37:27 PM a modular multiplication is included to calculate `ans`.  A factorial function was uncommented around 4:37:56 PM and used in the final version of the code to calculate `z`.  The final, complete code (4:41:20 PM) calculates and outputs the values `qt` (the number of repeated characters) and `ans` (likely representing the final answer) for each test case.  The commented-out code sections remained unchanged throughout.  The `C_Scoring_Subsequences.cpp` file's log only shows a template file with commented-out code similar to the initial state of `C_Make_it_Alternating.cpp`.
