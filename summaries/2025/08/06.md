# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 12:20:56 AM
The log shows modifications to the `D_Divide_and_Equalize.cpp` file between 12:02:37 AM and 12:03:13 AM on August 6, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, the `CutiePie()` function was incomplete, only declaring an integer `n` and a vector `v`.  Subsequent edits progressively added functionality.  By 12:02:56 AM, a loop to populate the vector `v` with `n` integer inputs was started, but was incomplete. At 12:03:03 AM, the input reading inside the loop was corrected to `cin >> x;`. Finally, by 12:03:13 AM,  the loop was completed by adding `v.push_back(x);` to store the inputs in the vector.

The commented-out code sections at the beginning of the file remain unchanged throughout the log and appear to be commented-out implementations for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculation and common mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr).  These were not modified during this period of edits.  The main function remains largely consistent, indicating that the focus of the changes was specifically on the `CutiePie()` function.


## 4:10:47 PM
The file `C:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\C_Make_it_Alternating.cpp` underwent several modifications on August 6, 2025.  The main changes focused on the `CutiePie()` function within the code.

Initially, at 3:10:51 PM, `CutiePie()` was an empty function.  At 3:11:00 PM, a `string s;` declaration was added inside `CutiePie()`.  At 3:11:07 PM, the function was further updated to read a string from standard input using `cin >> s;`.  A minor change at 3:11:14 PM removed the line `cin >> qt;`,  effectively making the program always execute `CutiePie()` once regardless of user input. Finally, at 4:04:39 PM, the `CutiePie()` function was reverted to its initial empty state.

Throughout these changes,  commented-out code blocks remained consistently present, suggesting potential helper functions (factorial, power, modInverse, nCr, sieve, and divisor calculation) that were not utilized in the final version.  The commented code suggests the exploration of various mathematical functions that were ultimately not necessary for the implemented solution.  The rapid succession of changes between 3:11:00 PM and 3:11:14 PM indicates a period of active development and testing, potentially related to input handling and program logic.
