# Activity Summary for 8/10/2025

## 12:19:38 PM
The file `C_Chat_Ban.cpp` underwent significant changes between 11:22 AM and 11:51 AM on August 10, 2025.  Initially, the `CutiePie()` function was empty.  The code then evolved through several iterations, adding variables (`k`, `x`), introducing a binary search (`low`, `high`, `mid`), calculating a cumulative count (`ct`) based on a `sum()` function, and finally, incorporating a binary search algorithm to find and output the result (`ans`). The `sum(x)` function, defined as `(x * (x + 1)) / 2`, was added to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to x.  The commented-out sections at the beginning of the file suggest the presence of commented-out code related to sieve, calculating divisors, and other mathematical functions; these remained unchanged throughout the modification process.  The final change at 12:04 PM simply contains a single character 'f' and is likely an error or an incomplete commit.  The core logic implemented involves a binary search within a specific range to find a value based on the calculated cumulative count.


## 3:19:37 PM
The log shows a single code file, `C_Deep_Down_Below.cpp`, updated on August 10, 2025, at 3:12:43 PM.  The file contains a C++ program with commented-out code for various mathematical functions, including sieve of Eratosthenes (commented out), calculation of divisors (commented out), factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr (all commented out). The main function currently only includes a loop that executes a `CutiePie()` function (which is empty) a number of times specified by user input.  The commented-out sections suggest the code was initially intended to perform various number-theoretic calculations but has since been simplified or refocused.  The use of `#define int long long` indicates an intention to handle larger integer values.  The timestamp represents the last modification to the file.


## 4:19:40 PM
The log shows a single file, `C_Deep_Down_Below.cpp`, undergoing extensive modification between 3:30 PM and 4:14 PM on August 10, 2025.  The file is a C++ program.

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculation, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions.  These were likely  placeholders or remnants from previous iterations.

The `CutiePie` function was the focus of the edits. It evolved from an empty function to a function that:

1. Takes an integer input `n`.
2. Creates a vector of pairs (`vector<pair<int,int>>vp`).
3. Iterates `n` times, each time reading an integer `x`, then iterating `x` times, reading another integer `y` to calculate `maxi` as the maximum value of `y - j + 1`.
4. The pair `(maxi, i+1)` is then pushed onto the vector `vp`.
5. Finally (in the last version), the `vp` vector is sorted.

The main changes were incremental additions to the `CutiePie` function, gradually building its functionality.  The final version calculates a maximum value within nested loops and then uses this maximum value in a further calculation involving sorting.  There's a commented out section for printing the contents of `vp` which was likely removed after debugging. The commented out code suggests the program might be designed to perform some type of number-theoretic calculations or combinatorics.  The final code seems to find a maximum value related to an input sequence of sequences and then perform further processing based on the result.
