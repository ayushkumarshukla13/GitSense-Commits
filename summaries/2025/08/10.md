# Activity Summary for 8/10/2025

## 12:19:38 PM
The file `C_Chat_Ban.cpp` underwent significant changes between 11:22 AM and 11:51 AM on August 10, 2025.  Initially, the `CutiePie()` function was empty.  The code then evolved through several iterations, adding variables (`k`, `x`), introducing a binary search (`low`, `high`, `mid`), calculating a cumulative count (`ct`) based on a `sum()` function, and finally, incorporating a binary search algorithm to find and output the result (`ans`). The `sum(x)` function, defined as `(x * (x + 1)) / 2`, was added to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to x.  The commented-out sections at the beginning of the file suggest the presence of commented-out code related to sieve, calculating divisors, and other mathematical functions; these remained unchanged throughout the modification process.  The final change at 12:04 PM simply contains a single character 'f' and is likely an error or an incomplete commit.  The core logic implemented involves a binary search within a specific range to find a value based on the calculated cumulative count.
