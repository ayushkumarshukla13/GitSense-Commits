# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

## 8:58:26 PM
The log shows multiple C++ files being modified on August 13, 2025.  The files `Brick_Comparisions.cpp`, `Fence_Colouring.cpp`, and `Subtract_or_Divide.cpp` all exhibit a similar structure, including a common header, macros (`#define int long long`, `#define MOD 1000000007`), and commented-out code sections for sieve, caldiv, and various math functions (factorial, power, modInverse, nCr). This suggests a common template or boilerplate is used across these files.

**`Brick_Comparisions.cpp`**: This file underwent two edits within a short time frame (8:01:28 PM and 8:01:59 PM). The core change was the addition of code within the `CutiePie()` function to find the index of the maximum element in a vector and print the index + 1. The initial version had a blank loop; the second version includes the logic to find the maximum and its index.

**`Fence_Colouring.cpp`**: This file had multiple edits between 8:05:29 PM and 8:17:24 PM. These revisions show an iterative development process. The initial version of `CutiePie()` was incomplete. Subsequent revisions added input reading, a `map` to count element occurrences, a `set` to find unique elements, and finally, a complete solution that finds the number of unique colors, handling the case where the first color is 1 separately.  The final version (8:17:24 PM) provides a concise and efficient solution using a `map` to count element frequencies and determining the result based on whether the count of element 1 exceeds the maximum count of other elements.

**`Subtract_or_Divide.cpp`**: This file also shows a progressive refinement. It started with an incomplete `CutiePie()` function (8:34:23 PM).  Subsequent versions gradually developed the logic to count the number of times a number can be divided by 2 and then add the result to the number of steps needed to reach 1.  The final, efficient version (8:40:46 PM) directly calculates the result without using the `CutiePie()` function, handling both even and odd cases correctly. Notably, this final version also uses a more standard `main` function structure and removes some of the commented-out boilerplate code.

In summary, the log tracks the development of three separate C++ programs to solve different algorithmic problems.  While they share a common template, the core logic of each program was developed incrementally over time, with the final versions reflecting efficient and complete solutions. The `B_Shuffle.cpp` file, however, remains unchanged throughout the log.


## 10:58:15 PM
The log shows the evolution of the `Grid_MEX.cpp` file over a short period (approximately 20 minutes) on August 13, 2025.  The primary changes center around the `CutiePie` function.

Initially, `CutiePie` was empty.  Subsequent edits added nested for loops iterating from 0 to `n` (where `n` is a user input).  Inside these loops, there was a progressive refinement:

* **9:01:04 PM:** An `ans` variable was initialized, suggesting the intention to accumulate a result. The loop body remained incomplete.
* **9:01:22 PM:** The inner loop body was added, but lacked any operation.
* **9:01:30 PM:**  The inner loop was completed by adding a semicolon ; to the empty loop body.
* **9:01:37 PM:** An attempt to print something inside the inner loop was made, but only `co` was added, incomplete.
* **9:02:00 PM:** The code within the nested loops was finalized to print `(ans)%n` and increment `ans`. This likely aims to generate a sequence modulo n.
* **9:02:21 PM:** A `cout<<endl;` statement was added to move to the next line after each row of the output and `ans` was reset to `a+1` after each inner loop.

The commented-out sections at the beginning of the file indicate the presence of code for sieve of Eratosthenes, calculation of divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr. These functions were initially included but were not used in the final version of the code.  The main function remains largely unchanged, simply reading an integer `qt` (always 1 in the log) and repeatedly calling `CutiePie`.
