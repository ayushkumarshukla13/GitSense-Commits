# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

## 8:58:26 PM
The log shows multiple C++ files being modified on August 13, 2025.  The files `Brick_Comparisions.cpp`, `Fence_Colouring.cpp`, and `Subtract_or_Divide.cpp` all exhibit a similar structure, including a common header, macros (`#define int long long`, `#define MOD 1000000007`), and commented-out code sections for sieve, caldiv, and various math functions (factorial, power, modInverse, nCr). This suggests a common template or boilerplate is used across these files.

**`Brick_Comparisions.cpp`**: This file underwent two edits within a short time frame (8:01:28 PM and 8:01:59 PM). The core change was the addition of code within the `CutiePie()` function to find the index of the maximum element in a vector and print the index + 1. The initial version had a blank loop; the second version includes the logic to find the maximum and its index.

**`Fence_Colouring.cpp`**: This file had multiple edits between 8:05:29 PM and 8:17:24 PM. These revisions show an iterative development process. The initial version of `CutiePie()` was incomplete. Subsequent revisions added input reading, a `map` to count element occurrences, a `set` to find unique elements, and finally, a complete solution that finds the number of unique colors, handling the case where the first color is 1 separately.  The final version (8:17:24 PM) provides a concise and efficient solution using a `map` to count element frequencies and determining the result based on whether the count of element 1 exceeds the maximum count of other elements.

**`Subtract_or_Divide.cpp`**: This file also shows a progressive refinement. It started with an incomplete `CutiePie()` function (8:34:23 PM).  Subsequent versions gradually developed the logic to count the number of times a number can be divided by 2 and then add the result to the number of steps needed to reach 1.  The final, efficient version (8:40:46 PM) directly calculates the result without using the `CutiePie()` function, handling both even and odd cases correctly. Notably, this final version also uses a more standard `main` function structure and removes some of the commented-out boilerplate code.

In summary, the log tracks the development of three separate C++ programs to solve different algorithmic problems.  While they share a common template, the core logic of each program was developed incrementally over time, with the final versions reflecting efficient and complete solutions. The `B_Shuffle.cpp` file, however, remains unchanged throughout the log.
