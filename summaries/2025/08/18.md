# Activity Summary for 8/18/2025

## 12:45:08 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`B_Average_Sleep_Time.cpp`) over a short period (approximately 30 minutes).  The initial version at 4:15:27 AM contains commented-out code for various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations), and a `CutiePie` function that is initially empty.

Between 4:15:27 AM and 4:16:19 AM, the `CutiePie` function is progressively developed.  It starts by taking two integer inputs (`n` and `m`) and then creates a vector `v` to store `n` integers read from standard input.  The addition of a `totaldigits` variable suggests the program is starting to count digits.

From 4:16:19 AM to 4:21:19 AM, the code focuses on counting trailing zeros. A `trailingzeroes` array is introduced to store the number of trailing zeros for each element in vector `v`. The code iteratively divides each number in `v` by 10 until it's no longer divisible by 10, counting the number of times this happens.

Between 4:21:19 AM and 4:22:48 AM, the `CutiePie` function is further refined.  The code now also counts the total number of digits in the numbers after removing the trailing zeros. It then sorts the `trailingzeroes` array in descending order.


Finally, between 4:40:57 AM and 4:41:47 AM, the code incorporates a conditional statement. The program checks if `totaldigits` (total digits after removing trailing zeros) exceeds `m`. If it does, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna".  This indicates the program likely solves a problem involving digit counts and a threshold.  The final commit completes the logic by adding the `cout<<"Anna"<<endl;` statement to handle the case when `totaldigits` is not greater than `m`.

The commented-out code suggests the program may have initially been designed to perform more complex mathematical operations but ultimately focuses on a problem related to counting digits and trailing zeros within a numerical input. The frequent updates suggest iterative development and debugging.


## 2:45:07 PM
The log shows edits to a single C++ file, `B_Average_Sleep_Time.cpp`, focused on a function `CutiePie` which calculates a penalty based on sleep times.

The first revision (8/18/2025, 1:48:49 PM) contains a `CutiePie` function using `long long` data types for variables like `n`, `val`, `sl`, and `tl`.  The function calculates a penalty related to sleep times, comparing inputs against minimums (`sl`, `tl`).

The second revision (8/18/2025, 1:49:07 PM) introduces a second version of `CutiePie` using `int` instead of `long long`, and this version remains alongside the `long long` version in the code.  Both versions compute the penalty in essentially the same way using two minimum values.


The third revision (8/18/2025, 1:49:22 PM) removes the redundant `long long` version of `CutiePie`, leaving only the `int` version.  This suggests a simplification or correction of the original approach.

Throughout the log, commented-out code for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculation, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions are present but remain unchanged, indicating they are not directly involved in the core modifications of the main function.  The commented out code was likely previously used but deemed irrelevant to the current functionality. The main changes focused solely on refining the `CutiePie` function's data types and logic for calculating the penalty.
