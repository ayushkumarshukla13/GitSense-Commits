# Activity Summary for 8/18/2025

## 12:45:08 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`B_Average_Sleep_Time.cpp`) over a short period (approximately 30 minutes).  The initial version at 4:15:27 AM contains commented-out code for various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations), and a `CutiePie` function that is initially empty.

Between 4:15:27 AM and 4:16:19 AM, the `CutiePie` function is progressively developed.  It starts by taking two integer inputs (`n` and `m`) and then creates a vector `v` to store `n` integers read from standard input.  The addition of a `totaldigits` variable suggests the program is starting to count digits.

From 4:16:19 AM to 4:21:19 AM, the code focuses on counting trailing zeros. A `trailingzeroes` array is introduced to store the number of trailing zeros for each element in vector `v`. The code iteratively divides each number in `v` by 10 until it's no longer divisible by 10, counting the number of times this happens.

Between 4:21:19 AM and 4:22:48 AM, the `CutiePie` function is further refined.  The code now also counts the total number of digits in the numbers after removing the trailing zeros. It then sorts the `trailingzeroes` array in descending order.


Finally, between 4:40:57 AM and 4:41:47 AM, the code incorporates a conditional statement. The program checks if `totaldigits` (total digits after removing trailing zeros) exceeds `m`. If it does, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna".  This indicates the program likely solves a problem involving digit counts and a threshold.  The final commit completes the logic by adding the `cout<<"Anna"<<endl;` statement to handle the case when `totaldigits` is not greater than `m`.

The commented-out code suggests the program may have initially been designed to perform more complex mathematical operations but ultimately focuses on a problem related to counting digits and trailing zeros within a numerical input. The frequent updates suggest iterative development and debugging.
