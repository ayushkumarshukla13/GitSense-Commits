# Activity Summary for 8/5/2025

## 12:43:12 AM
The log shows the evolution of the `B_Rock_and_Lever.cpp` file between 8/4/2025, 10:52 PM and 11:08 PM, and a single entry for `D_Divisible_Pairs.cpp` at 8/5/2025, 12:35 AM.

The `B_Rock_and_Lever.cpp` file underwent significant changes primarily focused on the `CutiePie()` function.  Initially, this function was incomplete.  Over a series of edits (between 10:52 PM and 11:08 PM), the code was developed to:

1. **Read input:**  The function now reads an integer `n` representing the size of an input vector and then reads `n` integers into a vector `v`.

2. **Bitwise XOR operations:** A crucial addition was a nested loop iterating from 0 to 32, performing a bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between each element of `v` and `(1 << i)`.  This suggests an attempt to find pairs with specific bit patterns.  The logic was refined several times, with intermediate steps involving storing the results in another vector `v1` and then counting occurrences using a map `mp`.

3. **Final Calculation and Output:** The final version of `CutiePie()` calculates `ans` based on counts from the map, implying a problem involving counting pairs that meet some condition.  The `ans` variable is calculated using a combination formula `x.second*(x.second-1)/2`, suggesting that the code is trying to find pairs.  Earlier versions of the code contained commented-out sections to calculate `ans`, hinting at an iterative development process. The final code prints `ans` to the console.

The timestamps indicate a period of intensive development, with numerous small, incremental changes to the `CutiePie()` function, suggesting debugging and refinement.

The `D_Divisible_Pairs.cpp` file shows only an initial, empty `CutiePie()` function and a main function that is structurally similar to `B_Rock_and_Lever.cpp`. No significant changes were logged for this file.  The commented-out code in both files is identical, containing mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) that were ultimately not used in the final versions of `B_Rock_and_Lever.cpp`.
