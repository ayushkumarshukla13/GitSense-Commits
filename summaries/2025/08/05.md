# Activity Summary for 8/5/2025

## 12:43:12 AM
The log shows the evolution of the `B_Rock_and_Lever.cpp` file between 8/4/2025, 10:52 PM and 11:08 PM, and a single entry for `D_Divisible_Pairs.cpp` at 8/5/2025, 12:35 AM.

The `B_Rock_and_Lever.cpp` file underwent significant changes primarily focused on the `CutiePie()` function.  Initially, this function was incomplete.  Over a series of edits (between 10:52 PM and 11:08 PM), the code was developed to:

1. **Read input:**  The function now reads an integer `n` representing the size of an input vector and then reads `n` integers into a vector `v`.

2. **Bitwise XOR operations:** A crucial addition was a nested loop iterating from 0 to 32, performing a bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between each element of `v` and `(1 << i)`.  This suggests an attempt to find pairs with specific bit patterns.  The logic was refined several times, with intermediate steps involving storing the results in another vector `v1` and then counting occurrences using a map `mp`.

3. **Final Calculation and Output:** The final version of `CutiePie()` calculates `ans` based on counts from the map, implying a problem involving counting pairs that meet some condition.  The `ans` variable is calculated using a combination formula `x.second*(x.second-1)/2`, suggesting that the code is trying to find pairs.  Earlier versions of the code contained commented-out sections to calculate `ans`, hinting at an iterative development process. The final code prints `ans` to the console.

The timestamps indicate a period of intensive development, with numerous small, incremental changes to the `CutiePie()` function, suggesting debugging and refinement.

The `D_Divisible_Pairs.cpp` file shows only an initial, empty `CutiePie()` function and a main function that is structurally similar to `B_Rock_and_Lever.cpp`. No significant changes were logged for this file.  The commented-out code in both files is identical, containing mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) that were ultimately not used in the final versions of `B_Rock_and_Lever.cpp`.


## 3:32:26 PM
The log shows development on two C++ files: `D_Divisible_Pairs.cpp` and `D_Find_the_Different_Ones.cpp`.

`D_Divisible_Pairs.cpp` underwent significant changes between 12:41 PM and 3:05 PM.  Initially, the `CutiePie` function was incomplete.  Over several iterations, it was progressively developed to read input values (`n`, `x`, `y`), store them in a vector, and then use a map to count pairs satisfying divisibility conditions based on `x` and `y`.  The final version efficiently calculates and prints the count of such pairs. The data structure used changed from a nested map to a map of pairs for better efficiency, reflected in the final timestamp of 3:05:04 PM.


`D_Find_the_Different_Ones.cpp` was worked on between 3:05 PM and 3:12 PM.  The code's purpose is to find indices where consecutive elements in an input vector differ. The `CutiePie` function starts by reading input: an integer `n` representing the vector size and then `n` integers for the vector itself, followed by `q` queries. Each query contains integers `l` and `r`. The final version identifies and stores these indices in a `vector<int> ans`.  The function remains incomplete at the end of the log, lacking the implementation for processing `q` queries.


Both files contain commented-out code sections related to sieving for prime numbers and calculating divisors, suggesting that these functionalities were initially considered but later discarded.  The `#define int long long` in both files indicates the use of `long long` integers to handle potentially large numbers.  The use of `ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);` suggests an effort to optimize input/output operations.
