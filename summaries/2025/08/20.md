# Activity Summary for 8/20/2025

The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`C_Array_Game.cpp`) over a short period on August 20, 2025.  The program appears to solve a problem involving arrays and finding minimum differences.

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculation, and various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr). These were not used in the initial version of the program.

Between 9:02:24 AM and 9:05:02 AM, the `CutiePie` function was progressively developed. It started as an empty function, then added input for `n` and `k`, followed by reading an array `v` of size `n` and finally computing the minimum absolute difference `ans` between any two elements in `v`.

Between 9:05:02 AM and 9:08:20 AM, the `CutiePie` function was further refined to handle different values of `k`.  The logic was added to handle cases where `k` is 1, 2, or greater than or equal to 3. For `k>=3`, the output is 0; for `k==1`, the minimum element difference `ans` is outputted; for `k==2`, a nested loop iterates through the differences `a` to find the minimum difference between the differences.

Finally, at 9:09:54 AM, a minor correction was made: `INT_MAX` was changed to `LLONG_MAX` to ensure correct handling of potentially large differences, given that `int` was defined as `long long`.

The code consistently uses the `#define int long long` preprocessor directive, suggesting the need to handle larger integer values.  The commented-out code suggests that the programmer initially explored several algorithms or approaches before settling on the final solution.
