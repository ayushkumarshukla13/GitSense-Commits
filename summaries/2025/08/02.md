# Activity Summary for 8/2/2025

## 3:01:45 AM
The log shows modifications to a single C++ file, `C_Grandma_Capa_Knits_a_Scarf.cpp`,  on August 2nd, 2025.  The file contains commented-out code for various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) and sieve of Eratosthenes.  These functions remain unchanged throughout the log.

The key changes are within the `CutiePie()` function.

* **2:06:01 AM:** The `CutiePie()` function is empty.

* **2:10:35 AM:** The `CutiePie()` function is updated to read an integer `n` and a string `s` as input.  This is a significant change, adding core functionality.

* **2:10:46 AM:** No further changes are observed; the code remains identical to the previous entry.

The overall pattern suggests the programmer is developing a solution to a problem that involves reading an integer and a string as input. The commented-out code suggests exploration of various mathematical approaches which were ultimately not integrated into the final, or at least the logged, version of the `CutiePie` function.
