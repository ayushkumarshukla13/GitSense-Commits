# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

## 7:41:01 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `A_Forbidden_Integer.cpp` and `A_Unit_Array.cpp`.  `A_Forbidden_Integer.cpp` underwent significant changes between 6:41 AM and 7:00 AM, primarily focusing on the `CutiePie` function. This function initially lacked complete input reading and conditional statements, but was progressively developed to handle different cases based on the input variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The logic involves checking for a specific condition (`k==x && x==1`) and outputting "No" accordingly. Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" and a sequence of numbers (initially `x`, later consistently 1's, and finally a combination of 1's and k's depending on parity).  The commented-out code suggests exploration of sieve methods and divisor calculations, although these were not ultimately used in the final version.

`A_Unit_Array.cpp`, modified between 7:15 AM and 7:32 AM, focuses on a function `CutiePie` that takes an array as input, counts occurrences of 1 and other numbers, and calculates the minimum operations required to make the array contain only 1's.  The logic involves various conditional statements checking the counts of 1's (`c1`) and other numbers (`c2`), and adjusting the output operations (`ops`) based on whether the array size is even or odd and the relationship between `c1` and `c2`. The final version (7:32 AM) presents a refined, concise solution for calculating the number of operations.

Both programs exhibit a common pattern:  they start with commented-out code containing common algorithmic functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations), indicating an initial attempt at using more complex mathematical tools before adopting simpler, problem-specific approaches.  The use of `#define int long long` is also consistently used to handle larger numbers.


## 8:40:49 AM
The log shows a single file, `A_Unit_Array.cpp`, undergoing a single update on June 4, 2025, at 8:31:15 AM.  The file contains C++ code that solves a problem involving an array of 1s and 0s. The code calculates the minimum operations needed to make the count of 1s and 0s equal.  The code includes commented-out sections suggesting initially, the programmer explored using sieve methods (likely for prime number generation or divisor calculation) and factorial/power functions, but these were ultimately not used in the final solution. The `CutiePie()` function is the core logic for solving the problem.  The main function handles input/output and calls `CutiePie()` repeatedly for multiple test cases.


## 9:40:53 AM
The log shows edits to three C++ files: `A_Unit_Array.cpp`, `A_Twin_Permutations.cpp`, and `B_Blank_Space.cpp`.  All three files share a common structure, including the same preprocessor directives, commented-out code blocks (sieve, caldiv, factorial, power, modInverse, nCr functions), and a similar main function structure using a `CutiePie` function to process input.  The commented-out code suggests that these files were initially designed to include functionalities related to prime sieving, divisor calculation, and combinatorics, but these features were eventually unused in the final code.

`A_Unit_Array.cpp` (9:18:55 AM): This file contains a complete function `CutiePie` that determines the minimum operations needed to make the counts of 1s and 0s in an input array equal or satisfy certain conditions. The logic involves checking different cases based on the counts and parity of 1s and 0s.

`A_Twin_Permutations.cpp`: This file underwent several edits between 9:21:36 AM and 9:25:54 AM.  Initially, it was incomplete, with the `CutiePie` function only partially implemented.  Through multiple revisions, the code was completed to read an array of integers and output a modified array where each element `x` is replaced by `n + 1 - x`, effectively reversing the array relative to `n+1`.  The final version (9:25:54 AM) contains a complete and functional `CutiePie` function.  The empty commit at 9:25:54 AM might indicate a mistake or a temporary save.

`B_Blank_Space.cpp` (9:28:08 AM - 9:30:20 AM): This file's `CutiePie` function iteratively determines the maximum length of consecutive 0s in an input array.  The code goes through several revisions, fixing minor logical flaws in the counting and `max` function usage to arrive at a correct implementation. The most significant change is the correction of the initialization of `qt` to `INT_MIN` (9:29:15 AM) and ensuring `qt` is updated even when the array ends with zeros (9:30:20 AM).

In summary, the code changes demonstrate a process of iterative development and debugging.  The common code structure suggests that these files might belong to a set of problem solutions.  The majority of changes involved completing the core functionality of each problem's solution.  The timestamps clearly show the time progression of these iterative refinements.


## 10:40:56 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `A_Coins.cpp` and `A_Walking_Master.cpp`.  `A_Coins.cpp` undergoes extensive modification between 9:44 AM and 9:59 AM, primarily focusing on the `CutiePie()` function. Initially, it's empty, then it takes two integer inputs (a, b), and progressively develops logic based on the parity of 'a' and its modulo with 'b', finally resulting in a function that prints "YES" if 'a' is even or 'a' modulo 'b' is even, otherwise prints "NO".  The commented-out code suggests exploration of sieve, calculating divisors, and other mathematical functions which were eventually unused in the final version.

`A_Walking_Master.cpp` is developed between 10:32 AM and 10:37 AM.  The `CutiePie` function reads four integers (a, b, c, d) and implements logic to determine if a solution exists within specified constraints, ultimately calculating and printing a result or -1 if no solution is found.  The final version of this file is much shorter and directly calculates the output.

Both files share a common header,  `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, and define `int` as `long long`.  A significant amount of commented-out code is present in both files, suggesting experimentation with various algorithms and approaches during development.  The commented-out code shows attempts to implement sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor counting, but these features were not integrated into the final code.  The development of both programs shows an iterative process of adding conditions and refining logic, eventually reaching a functional solution.


## 11:40:59 AM
The log shows code development across four files: `A_We_Need_the_Zero.cpp`, `C_Prepend_and_Append.cpp`, and `A_Serval_and_Mocha_s_Array.cpp`, and `A_One_and_Two.cpp`.  All files share a common header and define macros like `int` and `MOD`.  Many commented-out code sections related to sieve, caldiv, factorial, power, modInverse, and nCr functions are present in all files, suggesting these functions were initially considered but later removed or unused in the final versions.


`A_We_Need_the_Zero.cpp`: This file underwent several modifications between 10:41:03 AM and 10:42:48 AM.  The primary changes involve refining the `CutiePie()` function to handle even and odd `n` cases, correctly printing either 1 (when XOR sum is 0 for even n) or the XOR sum itself for odd n.  The final version at 10:42:48 AM outputs -1 if the XOR sum is non-zero for even n.

`C_Prepend_and_Append.cpp`:  This file's evolution (10:44:40 AM - 10:47:46 AM) focuses on developing the `CutiePie()` function to count pairs of digits from the beginning and end of a string that add up to 1.  The code is iteratively debugged;  the final version calculates and prints the remaining string length after removing these pairs.  There is a correction made to handle cases where the result is negative by setting `ans` to 0.

`A_Serval_and_Mocha_s_Array.cpp`:  Modifications (11:17:45 AM - 11:21:14 AM) in this file are centered around the `CutiePie()` function which checks if there exists a pair of numbers in the input vector whose greatest common divisor is exactly 2. Initially it had some errors that were addressed in the following updates until the final version at 11:21:14 AM, where the code efficiently searches for such a pair and prints "Yes" if found, "No" otherwise.  The condition `__gcd(a,v[j])<=2` was added to optimize.


`A_One_and_Two.cpp`:  The `CutiePie()` function in this file undergoes significant revision (11:32:14 AM - 11:37:25 AM). The goal seems to be finding an index `i` such that the product of elements from index 0 to i is equal to its square root. The code is refined through several iterations, initially struggling with the logic. The final version (11:37:25 AM) correctly identifies and outputs the index, or -1 if no such index exists, using a cumulative product approach.


## 12:40:52 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `A_One_and_Two.cpp` and `A_Make_it_Beautiful.cpp`.  Both files heavily utilize commented-out code, suggesting code experimentation or the inclusion of utility functions.  The commented sections consistently include potential implementations for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr.  These were likely considered but not ultimately used in the final versions.

`A_One_and_Two.cpp` underwent several revisions between 11:51 AM and 11:53 AM. The core change involved refining the `CutiePie` function to count occurrences of 1s and 2s in an input vector and then determining the index where twice the count of 1s equals the count of 2s. The final version efficiently handles the edge case where only 1s are present, outputting 1, and outputs -1 if no such index exists.


`A_Make_it_Beautiful.cpp` was modified between 11:54 AM and 11:58 AM. The primary development involved creating a function `CutiePie` that reads a vector of integers, sorts it, and then checks if the first and last elements are different. If they are different, it prints "Yes" followed by the first and last elements, and then the remaining elements. Otherwise, it prints "No".  The code was incrementally improved to correctly handle the output format and edge cases.  The final version at 11:58 AM presents a complete and functional solution.


## 1:40:55 PM
The log shows development on two C++ files: `A_Everybody_Likes_Good_Arrays.cpp` and `A_Extremely_Round.cpp`.

`A_Everybody_Likes_Good_Arrays.cpp`:  This file underwent significant changes between 1:01 PM and 1:03 PM.  Initially, the `CutiePie` function was empty.  The code was then progressively developed to read an integer `n`, input a vector `v` of size `n`, and iterate through the vector. The final version calculates the total number of times consecutive elements in the vector have the same parity (both even or both odd) and outputs this count.

`A_Extremely_Round.cpp`: Development on this file spanned from 1:16 PM to 1:32 PM. The `CutiePie` function was initially designed to handle inputs less than 10. The majority of the development focused on creating an algorithm to determine a specific value based on input `n`.  The approach involved finding the next power of 10 greater than n and then performing calculations based on that. The final version calculates a value based on the number of digits in the input `n`, outputting the result.  There was a brief period where the file was completely emptied at 1:27 PM.  The commented-out code at the top of both files suggests that the programmer was initially exploring functionalities like sieving, calculating divisors, and modular arithmetic, but these were ultimately unused in the final versions of both programs.  The frequent small commits indicate an iterative debugging and refinement process.
