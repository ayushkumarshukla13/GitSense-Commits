# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

## 7:41:01 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `A_Forbidden_Integer.cpp` and `A_Unit_Array.cpp`.  `A_Forbidden_Integer.cpp` underwent significant changes between 6:41 AM and 7:00 AM, primarily focusing on the `CutiePie` function. This function initially lacked complete input reading and conditional statements, but was progressively developed to handle different cases based on the input variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The logic involves checking for a specific condition (`k==x && x==1`) and outputting "No" accordingly. Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" and a sequence of numbers (initially `x`, later consistently 1's, and finally a combination of 1's and k's depending on parity).  The commented-out code suggests exploration of sieve methods and divisor calculations, although these were not ultimately used in the final version.

`A_Unit_Array.cpp`, modified between 7:15 AM and 7:32 AM, focuses on a function `CutiePie` that takes an array as input, counts occurrences of 1 and other numbers, and calculates the minimum operations required to make the array contain only 1's.  The logic involves various conditional statements checking the counts of 1's (`c1`) and other numbers (`c2`), and adjusting the output operations (`ops`) based on whether the array size is even or odd and the relationship between `c1` and `c2`. The final version (7:32 AM) presents a refined, concise solution for calculating the number of operations.

Both programs exhibit a common pattern:  they start with commented-out code containing common algorithmic functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations), indicating an initial attempt at using more complex mathematical tools before adopting simpler, problem-specific approaches.  The use of `#define int long long` is also consistently used to handle larger numbers.
