# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

## 7:41:01 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `A_Forbidden_Integer.cpp` and `A_Unit_Array.cpp`.  `A_Forbidden_Integer.cpp` underwent significant changes between 6:41 AM and 7:00 AM, primarily focusing on the `CutiePie` function. This function initially lacked complete input reading and conditional statements, but was progressively developed to handle different cases based on the input variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The logic involves checking for a specific condition (`k==x && x==1`) and outputting "No" accordingly. Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" and a sequence of numbers (initially `x`, later consistently 1's, and finally a combination of 1's and k's depending on parity).  The commented-out code suggests exploration of sieve methods and divisor calculations, although these were not ultimately used in the final version.

`A_Unit_Array.cpp`, modified between 7:15 AM and 7:32 AM, focuses on a function `CutiePie` that takes an array as input, counts occurrences of 1 and other numbers, and calculates the minimum operations required to make the array contain only 1's.  The logic involves various conditional statements checking the counts of 1's (`c1`) and other numbers (`c2`), and adjusting the output operations (`ops`) based on whether the array size is even or odd and the relationship between `c1` and `c2`. The final version (7:32 AM) presents a refined, concise solution for calculating the number of operations.

Both programs exhibit a common pattern:  they start with commented-out code containing common algorithmic functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations), indicating an initial attempt at using more complex mathematical tools before adopting simpler, problem-specific approaches.  The use of `#define int long long` is also consistently used to handle larger numbers.


## 8:40:49 AM
The log shows a single file, `A_Unit_Array.cpp`, undergoing a single update on June 4, 2025, at 8:31:15 AM.  The file contains C++ code that solves a problem involving an array of 1s and 0s. The code calculates the minimum operations needed to make the count of 1s and 0s equal.  The code includes commented-out sections suggesting initially, the programmer explored using sieve methods (likely for prime number generation or divisor calculation) and factorial/power functions, but these were ultimately not used in the final solution. The `CutiePie()` function is the core logic for solving the problem.  The main function handles input/output and calls `CutiePie()` repeatedly for multiple test cases.


## 9:40:53 AM
The log shows edits to three C++ files: `A_Unit_Array.cpp`, `A_Twin_Permutations.cpp`, and `B_Blank_Space.cpp`.  All three files share a common structure, including the same preprocessor directives, commented-out code blocks (sieve, caldiv, factorial, power, modInverse, nCr functions), and a similar main function structure using a `CutiePie` function to process input.  The commented-out code suggests that these files were initially designed to include functionalities related to prime sieving, divisor calculation, and combinatorics, but these features were eventually unused in the final code.

`A_Unit_Array.cpp` (9:18:55 AM): This file contains a complete function `CutiePie` that determines the minimum operations needed to make the counts of 1s and 0s in an input array equal or satisfy certain conditions. The logic involves checking different cases based on the counts and parity of 1s and 0s.

`A_Twin_Permutations.cpp`: This file underwent several edits between 9:21:36 AM and 9:25:54 AM.  Initially, it was incomplete, with the `CutiePie` function only partially implemented.  Through multiple revisions, the code was completed to read an array of integers and output a modified array where each element `x` is replaced by `n + 1 - x`, effectively reversing the array relative to `n+1`.  The final version (9:25:54 AM) contains a complete and functional `CutiePie` function.  The empty commit at 9:25:54 AM might indicate a mistake or a temporary save.

`B_Blank_Space.cpp` (9:28:08 AM - 9:30:20 AM): This file's `CutiePie` function iteratively determines the maximum length of consecutive 0s in an input array.  The code goes through several revisions, fixing minor logical flaws in the counting and `max` function usage to arrive at a correct implementation. The most significant change is the correction of the initialization of `qt` to `INT_MIN` (9:29:15 AM) and ensuring `qt` is updated even when the array ends with zeros (9:30:20 AM).

In summary, the code changes demonstrate a process of iterative development and debugging.  The common code structure suggests that these files might belong to a set of problem solutions.  The majority of changes involved completing the core functionality of each problem's solution.  The timestamps clearly show the time progression of these iterative refinements.


## 10:40:56 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `A_Coins.cpp` and `A_Walking_Master.cpp`.  `A_Coins.cpp` undergoes extensive modification between 9:44 AM and 9:59 AM, primarily focusing on the `CutiePie()` function. Initially, it's empty, then it takes two integer inputs (a, b), and progressively develops logic based on the parity of 'a' and its modulo with 'b', finally resulting in a function that prints "YES" if 'a' is even or 'a' modulo 'b' is even, otherwise prints "NO".  The commented-out code suggests exploration of sieve, calculating divisors, and other mathematical functions which were eventually unused in the final version.

`A_Walking_Master.cpp` is developed between 10:32 AM and 10:37 AM.  The `CutiePie` function reads four integers (a, b, c, d) and implements logic to determine if a solution exists within specified constraints, ultimately calculating and printing a result or -1 if no solution is found.  The final version of this file is much shorter and directly calculates the output.

Both files share a common header,  `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, and define `int` as `long long`.  A significant amount of commented-out code is present in both files, suggesting experimentation with various algorithms and approaches during development.  The commented-out code shows attempts to implement sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor counting, but these features were not integrated into the final code.  The development of both programs shows an iterative process of adding conditions and refining logic, eventually reaching a functional solution.
