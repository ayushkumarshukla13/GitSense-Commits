# Activity Summary for 6/15/2025

## 12:11:02 AM
Between 11:12 PM and 11:16 PM on June 14, 2025,  the frontend of the "Coding Platform" application underwent significant updates.  A basic `Homepage.jsx` component was created.  `Login.jsx` and `Signup.jsx` components were implemented using `react-hook-form`, `zod` for validation, and DaisyUI for styling.  These components feature input fields for email, password, and first name (in `Signup.jsx`), with error handling based on `zod` schema validation.  The project utilizes Tailwind CSS and React Router for routing between the homepage, login, and signup pages.  A `.gitignore` file was added to manage ignored files.  `package.json` and `package-lock.json` reflect the project's dependencies, including React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and zod. Vite is used as the build tool. The `Homepage.jsx` component in the `09frontendDay02` folder was also modified to have an empty return statement.

Subsequently, between 11:38 PM and 11:52 PM on June 14, 2025, the backend (`Codenopsis`)  `userAuthent.js` controller was developed.  This controller handles user registration, login, logout, and profile deletion.  It uses bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for authentication, and Redis for token management (blocking logged-out tokens). Multiple commits show iterative improvements to the login functionality, specifically refining the response to include user details.  The final version returns the user's information in the response, improving the API's functionality.

Finally, between 12:07 AM and 12:10 AM on June 15, 2025, the backend routes (`userAuth.js`) were created to handle user authentication requests. These routes use middleware to protect certain endpoints and include a `/check` endpoint to verify user authentication status, returning the user's information.  Multiple commits show iterative development of the get request to return the user details after successful authentication.
