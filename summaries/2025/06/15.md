# Activity Summary for 6/15/2025

## 12:11:02 AM
Between 11:12 PM and 11:16 PM on June 14, 2025,  the frontend of the "Coding Platform" application underwent significant updates.  A basic `Homepage.jsx` component was created.  `Login.jsx` and `Signup.jsx` components were implemented using `react-hook-form`, `zod` for validation, and DaisyUI for styling.  These components feature input fields for email, password, and first name (in `Signup.jsx`), with error handling based on `zod` schema validation.  The project utilizes Tailwind CSS and React Router for routing between the homepage, login, and signup pages.  A `.gitignore` file was added to manage ignored files.  `package.json` and `package-lock.json` reflect the project's dependencies, including React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and zod. Vite is used as the build tool. The `Homepage.jsx` component in the `09frontendDay02` folder was also modified to have an empty return statement.

Subsequently, between 11:38 PM and 11:52 PM on June 14, 2025, the backend (`Codenopsis`)  `userAuthent.js` controller was developed.  This controller handles user registration, login, logout, and profile deletion.  It uses bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for authentication, and Redis for token management (blocking logged-out tokens). Multiple commits show iterative improvements to the login functionality, specifically refining the response to include user details.  The final version returns the user's information in the response, improving the API's functionality.

Finally, between 12:07 AM and 12:10 AM on June 15, 2025, the backend routes (`userAuth.js`) were created to handle user authentication requests. These routes use middleware to protect certain endpoints and include a `/check` endpoint to verify user authentication status, returning the user's information.  Multiple commits show iterative development of the get request to return the user details after successful authentication.

The log shows the development of a React frontend application named "Codenopsis" between 1:43 PM and 1:53 PM on June 15, 2025.  The changes span multiple files, indicating a significant update to the application's authentication and routing features.

**Homepage.jsx:** A basic Homepage component was created. This is a simple component, merely rendering "HomePage".

**Login.jsx & Signup.jsx:**  These components implement user login and signup functionalities, respectively. Both use React Hook Form with Zod for validation, React Redux for state management, and React Router for navigation.  They share a similar structure and styling, utilizing Tailwind CSS classes for layout and form elements.  Both components dispatch Redux actions (`loginUser` and `registerUser`) upon form submission.  Error handling is implemented using Zod's validation schema and feedback is displayed to the user. The signup form adds a `firstName` field, while the login form only needs `emailId` and `password`.

**store.js:** A Redux store was configured, integrating the `authReducer` to manage authentication state.

**axiosClient.js:** An Axios instance was configured with a base URL pointing to a backend server running locally on port 3000; this will likely handle the API calls for authentication. `withCredentials: true` indicates cookies will be used for session management.

**App.jsx:** The main application component uses React Router to define routes.  Based on authentication status (retrieved from Redux), it redirects users to appropriate pages (Homepage if logged in, Signup otherwise).  It uses a `useEffect` hook to dispatch a `checkAuth` action on component mount, ensuring authentication status is established initially.

**authSlice.js:** This file contains the Redux slice for authentication, defining asynchronous thunks for user registration, login, authentication check, and logout. Each thunk interacts with the `axiosClient` to communicate with the backend, handling pending, fulfilled, and rejected states appropriately.  The error handling is centralized here.

**index.css:** This file imports Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, providing styling for the application's UI components.

**main.jsx:** The main entry point for the app, setting up the React app with React StrictMode, Redux Provider, and React Router.

**Other files (.gitignore, index.html, package-lock.json, package.json, vite.config.js):** These files contain standard configuration data for the project, version control, build process, and dependency management.  `package.json` shows that the frontend uses a variety of libraries, indicating a relatively modern frontend stack.  Note that the two `package-lock.json` entries appear to be associated with the frontend and a separate backend project (day01), which was updated at a different time.


The timestamps reveal a highly concentrated development period, with all frontend-related files being committed within a relatively short timeframe.  The pattern of using React Hook Form, Zod, React Redux, and Axios is consistent across multiple components, suggesting a well-structured and maintainable codebase.  The clear separation of concerns between the authentication logic (`authSlice.js`) and the UI components (`Login.jsx`, `Signup.jsx`) is a positive sign.
