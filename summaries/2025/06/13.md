# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 9:41:17 AM
The log shows several code changes made between 11:24 PM and 11:27 PM on June 12, 2025.  The key changes revolve around user authentication (`userAuthent.js`), problem creation (`userProblem.js`), and associated middleware (`adminMiddleware.js`, `userMiddleware.js`).  There's also supporting model (`problem.js`) and utility (`problemUtility.js`, `validator.js`) updates.

`userAuthent.js`:  This file underwent several minor revisions. The most significant change was uncommenting a line in the `register` function (`const user = await User.create(req.body);`), allowing user creation to proceed. This modification happened between 11:24:46 PM and 11:24:56 PM. The file handles user registration, login, and logout functionalities using JWTs and Redis for token blocking.

`userProblem.js`: This file, dealing with problem creation, saw refinements in its problem testing logic.  Between 11:25:11 PM and 11:25:41 PM, unnecessary comments and console logs were removed, simplifying the code which submits the problem's reference solution to an external judge (Judge0) and then confirms the result.

`adminMiddleware.js` and `userMiddleware.js`:  These middleware functions both implement authentication using JWTs and Redis for token validation, checking for the presence of a token, its validity and if the user is blocked. The `adminMiddleware.js` adds a role check to ensure the user is an admin.  These were added at 11:25:48 PM and 11:25:54 PM respectively.

`problem.js`: This file defines the Mongoose schema for the `Problem` model. The schema includes fields for title, description, difficulty, tags, test cases (visible and hidden), start code, reference solution, and the problem creator.  This was added at 11:26:06 PM.

`userAuth.js`: This file defines the routing for authentication endpoints, leveraging the middleware created above to protect admin-specific routes.  This was added at 11:26:36 PM.

`problemUtility.js`: This utility file handles the interaction with Judge0 API.  It has functions for getting language IDs, submitting code batches, and retrieving the results.  A minor revision was made at 11:26:55 PM to remove unnecessary comments. The file uses an API key (redacted from output) to interact with the Judge0 service for problem testing.

`validator.js`: This file contains a validation function ensuring that mandatory fields (`firstName`, `emailId`, `password`) are present and that the email is valid and the password is strong, according to validator.js. This was added at 11:27:00 PM.

In summary, the code changes reflect the implementation of a user authentication system with admin privileges and a system for creating and testing coding problems, integrating with an external code judging service.  The changes show a focus on improving code clarity and efficiency by removing unnecessary code and streamlining the problem testing logic.
