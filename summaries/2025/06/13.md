# Activity Summary for 6/13/2025

## 9:41:17 AM
The log shows several code changes made between 11:24 PM and 11:27 PM on June 12, 2025.  The key changes revolve around user authentication (`userAuthent.js`), problem creation (`userProblem.js`), and associated middleware (`adminMiddleware.js`, `userMiddleware.js`).  There's also supporting model (`problem.js`) and utility (`problemUtility.js`, `validator.js`) updates.

`userAuthent.js`:  This file underwent several minor revisions. The most significant change was uncommenting a line in the `register` function (`const user = await User.create(req.body);`), allowing user creation to proceed. This modification happened between 11:24:46 PM and 11:24:56 PM. The file handles user registration, login, and logout functionalities using JWTs and Redis for token blocking.

`userProblem.js`: This file, dealing with problem creation, saw refinements in its problem testing logic.  Between 11:25:11 PM and 11:25:41 PM, unnecessary comments and console logs were removed, simplifying the code which submits the problem's reference solution to an external judge (Judge0) and then confirms the result.

`adminMiddleware.js` and `userMiddleware.js`:  These middleware functions both implement authentication using JWTs and Redis for token validation, checking for the presence of a token, its validity and if the user is blocked. The `adminMiddleware.js` adds a role check to ensure the user is an admin.  These were added at 11:25:48 PM and 11:25:54 PM respectively.

`problem.js`: This file defines the Mongoose schema for the `Problem` model. The schema includes fields for title, description, difficulty, tags, test cases (visible and hidden), start code, reference solution, and the problem creator.  This was added at 11:26:06 PM.

`userAuth.js`: This file defines the routing for authentication endpoints, leveraging the middleware created above to protect admin-specific routes.  This was added at 11:26:36 PM.

`problemUtility.js`: This utility file handles the interaction with Judge0 API.  It has functions for getting language IDs, submitting code batches, and retrieving the results.  A minor revision was made at 11:26:55 PM to remove unnecessary comments. The file uses an API key (redacted from output) to interact with the Judge0 service for problem testing.

`validator.js`: This file contains a validation function ensuring that mandatory fields (`firstName`, `emailId`, `password`) are present and that the email is valid and the password is strong, according to validator.js. This was added at 11:27:00 PM.

In summary, the code changes reflect the implementation of a user authentication system with admin privileges and a system for creating and testing coding problems, integrating with an external code judging service.  The changes show a focus on improving code clarity and efficiency by removing unnecessary code and streamlining the problem testing logic.


## 10:41:22 AM
The log shows a series of code changes made between 10:11 AM and 10:24 AM on June 13, 2025, primarily focused on a coding platform application named "Codenopsis".  The updates span several files, indicating development across authentication, problem management, and middleware functionalities.

**`userAuthent.js` (Authentication Controller):**  This file underwent multiple revisions.  Initially, the `adminRegister` function lacked the `User.create` call, which was added in subsequent commits. This file handles user registration and login using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token generation.  A logout feature was added, utilizing Redis for token blacklisting.  The final version at 10:15:26 AM shows a complete and functional authentication system.

**`userProblem.js` (Problem Controller):** This file manages problem creation, updates, deletion, and retrieval. The `createProblem` and `updateProblem` functions, added at 10:11:42 AM, both involve submitting code for testing using an external API (`judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com`).  Redundant console.logs were removed in later commits.  A series of commits between 10:15:41 AM and 10:16:35 AM streamlined the code within these functions by removing unnecessary comments and intermediate variables, making the code more concise.

**`adminMiddleware.js` & `userMiddleware.js` (Middleware):**  Both files implement middleware for authentication, checking for the presence and validity of JWT tokens and verifying the token isn't blocked in Redis.  The key difference is that `adminMiddleware.js` additionally verifies if the user has an 'admin' role.  These were updated at 10:16:45 AM and 10:17:36 AM respectively to remove redundant code.

**`problem.js` (Problem Model):** This file defines the Mongoose schema for problems, including fields for title, description, difficulty, tags, test cases, start code, reference solutions, and the problem creator. The schema was finalized at 10:17:48 AM.

**`submission.js` (Submission Model):** This file defines the Mongoose schema for user submissions, containing details like user ID, problem ID, code, language, status, runtime, memory usage, and test case results. The final version was created at 10:21:41 AM and includes `testCasesTotal` field.


**`user.js` (User Model):** Defines the Mongoose schema for users, including fields for personal information, role, and password. Created at 10:12:58 AM.

**`problemCreator.js` (Problem Routes):**  This file defines the API routes for problem creation, updates, deletion, and retrieval. A commented-out route (`/problemSolvedByUser`) suggests planned functionality.  The final version at 10:24:03 AM removed this commented-out route.

**`userAuth.js` (Authentication Routes):**  Defines API routes for user registration, login, and logout. Updated at 10:18:38 AM to remove commented-out code.

**`problemUtility.js` (Utility Functions):** Contains functions to interact with the Judge0 API for code execution.  The `submitBatch` and `submitToken` functions are crucial for automated test case evaluation. There were multiple updates to the API key in the `submitBatch` function, initially using `ab99c6ec42mshfd636ec7c6687efp1b9043jsna684835b0591`, then `096038f454msh8c15578a4cfe8c9p114ba6jsn9edc7f1b10e2`.  The final version at 10:21:06 AM uses the latter key consistently in both `submitBatch` and `submitToken`.

**`validator.js` (Validation):**  Contains a function for validating user input during registration, checking for mandatory fields and valid email and password formats.  Created at 10:13:58 AM.

**`index.js` (Main Application):** Sets up the Express server, initializes database and Redis connections, and defines the API routes.  Created at 10:14:11 AM.

**`package.json` & `package-lock.json`:** These files manage project dependencies. The final version was at 10:14:30 AM and 10:14:21 AM respectively.

In summary, the major updates involved refining the authentication system, implementing robust problem management features including automated code testing via an external API, defining Mongoose schemas for users and problems, setting up API routes, and implementing validation and middleware for enhanced security.  The consistent use of Redis for token blacklisting and the use of the `judge0-ce` API for code execution are notable recurring elements.
