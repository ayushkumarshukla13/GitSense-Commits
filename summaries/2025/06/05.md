# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 8:44:08 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `A_Mainak_and_Array.cpp` and `B_NIT_Destroys_the_Universe.cpp`.  `A_Mainak_and_Array.cpp` underwent significant changes between 7:47 AM and 7:53 AM, primarily focusing on refining a function called `CutiePie`. This function reads an array, calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements and the difference between the last and first elements, and then outputs the maximum of these differences.  Initially, the code was incomplete, with errors in variable initialization and loop conditions.  These were progressively corrected, culminating in a complete and functional solution. The final version includes a conditional statement that optimizes the solution when the minimum or maximum element is at the start or end of the vector.

`B_NIT_Destroys_the_Universe.cpp` saw development from 8:04 AM to 8:09 AM.  The `CutiePie` function in this file takes an array as input and determines whether the array contains zeros between the first and last non-zero elements. If such zeros are present, the output is 2; otherwise, the output is 1.  If all elements are zero, the output is 0.  The code's evolution involved adding input reading, array sorting, and implementing the zero check logic. The final version is clean and addresses the problem statement directly.


Both files share a common structure:  they include numerous commented-out code snippets for sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculations, suggesting these were initially considered but ultimately not implemented in these specific problems.  Both also use the `CutiePie` function name, implying a coding style preference or a naming convention. The main function in both files reads the number of test cases and iterates through them, calling the `CutiePie` function for each.  This pattern suggests the code is designed to handle multiple input sets efficiently.
