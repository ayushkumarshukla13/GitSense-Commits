# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 8:44:08 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `A_Mainak_and_Array.cpp` and `B_NIT_Destroys_the_Universe.cpp`.  `A_Mainak_and_Array.cpp` underwent significant changes between 7:47 AM and 7:53 AM, primarily focusing on refining a function called `CutiePie`. This function reads an array, calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements and the difference between the last and first elements, and then outputs the maximum of these differences.  Initially, the code was incomplete, with errors in variable initialization and loop conditions.  These were progressively corrected, culminating in a complete and functional solution. The final version includes a conditional statement that optimizes the solution when the minimum or maximum element is at the start or end of the vector.

`B_NIT_Destroys_the_Universe.cpp` saw development from 8:04 AM to 8:09 AM.  The `CutiePie` function in this file takes an array as input and determines whether the array contains zeros between the first and last non-zero elements. If such zeros are present, the output is 2; otherwise, the output is 1.  If all elements are zero, the output is 0.  The code's evolution involved adding input reading, array sorting, and implementing the zero check logic. The final version is clean and addresses the problem statement directly.


Both files share a common structure:  they include numerous commented-out code snippets for sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculations, suggesting these were initially considered but ultimately not implemented in these specific problems.  Both also use the `CutiePie` function name, implying a coding style preference or a naming convention. The main function in both files reads the number of test cases and iterates through them, calling the `CutiePie` function for each.  This pattern suggests the code is designed to handle multiple input sets efficiently.


## 9:44:07 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`B_Make_It_Increasing.cpp`) designed to solve a problem involving increasing integer sequences.  The primary changes occur within the `CutiePie()` function, which processes an input vector of integers.

Early timestamps (8:47 AM) show the initial setup of the code, including the inclusion of standard libraries,  definitions, and commented-out code related to sieve methods and divisor calculations (these are not used in the final version). The `CutiePie()` function is initially incomplete.

Subsequent updates (between 8:47 AM and 8:49 AM) focus on iterating through the input vector (`a` and later `v`) from right to left, adding conditional logic (`if` statements) to check for non-increasing elements.  The algorithm's core logic is developed during this period. A variable `ct` is introduced to count operations.

Between 8:49 AM and 9:00 AM, the `while` loop is refined to handle multiple consecutive non-increasing elements. The condition `v[i] < v[i-1]` is consistently used.  `v[i-1]` is repeatedly halved (`v[i-1]/=2`) within the `while` loop.

From 9:00 AM onwards, minor refinements to the conditional statements are made, primarily adjusting the `if` condition to `v[i] <= v[i-1]` and refining the check for edge cases where `v[i-1]` becomes 0 within the inner loop.  The handling of the case where the sequence cannot be made increasing (`cout<<-1<<endl; return;`) is also added and adjusted in several versions to ensure it handles edge cases correctly.

At approximately 9:30 AM, the code becomes stable in structure, though minor corrections to the edge case handling continue.

Finally, around 9:40 AM a significant change occurs. The input vector `v` is initialized using `push_back`, rather than declaring its size in advance.  The loop structure in `CutiePie()` changes to iterate from `n-2` to 0, suggesting a potential algorithmic optimization.  This section includes some unfinished code, but it ultimately settles into a version that processes the vector in reverse order to check for and correct decreasing elements by repeatedly halving the preceding element while it remains greater than or equal to the current element.

The final code iterates through the input vector from right to left, and if an element is less than or equal to the previous element, it repeatedly divides the previous element by 2 until the increasing order is restored or the previous element reaches 0. The count of these divisions is tracked and outputted.  The program correctly handles cases where making the sequence increasing is impossible and returns -1 accordingly.


## 10:44:02 AM
The log shows development of two C++ programs: `D_Deletive_Editing.cpp` and `B_Array_Cloning_Technique.cpp`.

`D_Deletive_Editing.cpp` underwent significant changes between 9:51 AM and 10:03 AM.  The core functionality involves comparing two strings (`a` and `b`) after reversing them. The algorithm iterates through the reversed strings, using a map (`mb`) to track the frequency of characters in string `b`. If a character from reversed `a` is found in reversed `b`, it's processed; otherwise, a "NO" is printed and the function ends.  A "YES" is printed if all characters in reversed `b` are found in reversed `a` in the correct order.  The code was refined iteratively,  improving the logic for comparing characters and handling edge cases around character frequency.  Specifically, the condition for printing "YES" was initially incorrect and was fixed in the final version. The commented-out code suggests initial explorations of sieve methods (likely for prime number generation) and divisor calculations, which were ultimately not used in the final implementation.

`B_Array_Cloning_Technique.cpp`, developed between 10:15 AM and 10:24 AM, focuses on array processing. The program reads an array (`v`) and then creates a copy (`a`). Initially, it checked if the first and last elements of the copied array are equal, printing -1 (which was then corrected to 0). Later revisions introduced a map (`mp`) to count character frequencies, and the algorithm aimed to find the maximum frequency. The final version calculates `maxi` (maximum frequency) and uses it to determine an output, although the calculation of `ans` and `z` remains unfinished at the end of the log.  Like `D_Deletive_Editing.cpp`,  `B_Array_Cloning_Technique.cpp` also contains commented-out code related to sieve and divisor calculations, unused in the final code.


## 1:44:07 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `B_Array_Cloning_Technique.cpp` and `B_Make_AP.cpp`, both heavily using the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header and defining `int` as `long long`.  `B_Array_Cloning_Technique.cpp` underwent significant changes between 1:04 PM and 1:16 PM, focusing on refining a function called `CutiePie`.  Initially, `CutiePie` was empty. It evolved to read an integer `n`, input a vector `a` of size `n`, and then calculate the maximum frequency of elements within `a` using a map.  The final version calculates the minimum operations needed to make all elements of the vector equal, considering even or odd lengths.  The code contains commented-out code snippets suggesting exploration of sieve methods and divisor calculations, which were ultimately not used in the final version.

`B_Make_AP.cpp` was developed between 1:18 PM and 1:22 PM.  This program takes three integers (a, b, c) as input in its `CutiePie` function and checks if they can form an arithmetic progression in any order by applying several conditional checks.  The logic evolved from an incomplete implementation to a comprehensive solution using conditional statements to assess the possibility of forming an arithmetic progression. The final version efficiently determines if an arithmetic progression can be formed and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.  Like the previous file, it also contains commented-out code for sieve and divisor calculations that are not utilized in the program.


## 2:44:05 PM
The log shows edits to two C++ files, `B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` and `A_AB_Balance.cpp`.  The majority of changes are focused on `B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp`, indicating significant development effort on this problem.  This file underwent numerous revisions between 1:45 PM and 1:57 PM on June 5th, 2025, with frequent small edits suggesting iterative debugging and refinement.  The core logic involves handling even/odd numbers and modulo operations, particularly modulo 4. The commented-out sections suggest the initial exploration of various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) which were ultimately not used in the final version.  The code's structure also includes a `CutiePie` function that handles the main logic for the problem.

In contrast, `A_AB_Balance.cpp` shows fewer but more substantial changes between 2:02 PM and 2:31 PM on the same day. The edits center around  correcting a logic flaw for string manipulation related to 'a' and 'b' characters. The code initially attempted to simply swap the first character; subsequent revisions demonstrate  a more careful consideration of edge cases involving string lengths and the relation between the first and last characters of the input strings. The final version of this code implements conditional logic based on these conditions to manipulate the string accordingly.


## 3:44:07 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp` and `B_01_Game.cpp`, and one C++ program `A_Three_Indices.cpp`.  All three programs utilize a common structure including macros (`#define int long long`, `#define MOD 1000000007`), a constant `N`, and commented-out code suggesting previous attempts at sieve and divisor calculations.  The commented-out code was not modified throughout the log.

`B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp`: This program's evolution focuses on finding the minimum number of operations to make a number divisible by 25.  The initial versions (2:55 PM) show a very basic structure and then gradually develop into a more refined approach by extracting digits and implementing nested loops to check for combinations divisible by 25 (2:55 PM - 3:01 PM).  The code was significantly improved at around 3:01 PM, where  a more efficient approach was implemented, checking for combinations of 0s and 5s  to determine the minimum number of operations. The final version (3:12 PM) refines the logic for calculating the difference between indices.

`B_01_Game.cpp`:  This program (starting around 3:27 PM) processes a binary string to determine if the minimum number of 0s and 1s is even or odd. It starts with an incomplete `CutiePie` function and gradually develops to count 0s and 1s and then outputs "DA" if the minimum count is even, and "NET" otherwise (3:29 PM).

`A_Three_Indices.cpp`:  This program (starting around 3:32 PM) aims to find three indices in an array where the middle element is greater than its neighbors. It starts as an incomplete function and progresses towards finding such indices and outputting "YES" or "NO" (3:33 PM - 3:34 PM). The final version correctly identifies and prints the indices and "YES", or "NO" if no such indices exist.

The timestamps show a concentrated period of development between 2:55 PM and 3:04 PM for `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp`,  3:27 PM and 3:29 PM for `B_01_Game.cpp`, and 3:32 PM and 3:34 PM for `A_Three_Indices.cpp`.  Each program's development was largely linear, with incremental changes building upon previous versions.


## 4:44:02 PM
The log shows the evolution of two C++ files: `A_Strange_Partition.cpp` and `A_Odd_Divisor.cpp`.

`A_Strange_Partition.cpp` underwent extensive modification between 4:11 PM and 4:32 PM on June 5, 2025.  Initially, the code was incomplete, with a `CutiePie` function lacking a complete implementation.  Subsequent changes focused on refining this function: reading input values into a vector, calculating sums, and performing divisions and modulo operations, seemingly to solve a problem related to partitions and division. The final version calculates and outputs two values (`a` and `b`), likely representing different aspects of the partition or division.  Many commented-out code sections are present throughout, suggesting experimentation with different algorithms or approaches (Sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculations, and other mathematical functions).

`A_Odd_Divisor.cpp` saw minor changes between 4:35 PM and 4:36 PM on June 5, 2025. This file contains a `CutiePie` function that checks if a number is a power of 2. The initial version incorrectly checked for powers of 2; this was corrected in the second version.  The commented-out code in this file is similar to that in `A_Strange_Partition.cpp`, suggesting a consistent coding style and possibly the reuse of code snippets.


## 5:44:00 PM
The log shows edits to two C++ files: `B_Luntik_and_Subsequences.cpp` and `A_Mocha_and_Math.cpp`.

`B_Luntik_and_Subsequences.cpp` underwent several revisions between 4:47 PM and 4:48 PM on June 5th, 2025.  The primary change within the `CutiePie()` function was the correction of the logic for counting 0s and 1s in the input vector `v`. Initially, there were errors in the count and the final output. The code evolved from an incomplete output to correctly calculating and printing the product of the count of 1s and the count of 0s (where the count of 0s is calculated as 2 raised to the power of the number of 0s).  The final version includes `endl` for proper output formatting.  The commented-out code at the beginning remains unchanged throughout the revisions; this commented-out code suggests the presence of functions for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr.

`A_Mocha_and_Math.cpp` was edited between 4:54 PM and 4:55 PM on June 5th, 2025. The `CutiePie()` function was modified to take `n` inputs and perform a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on them, accumulating the result in the `ans` variable.  The initial version of `CutiePie` lacked input reading and computation, while the final version correctly reads `n` integers and calculates the bitwise AND, printing the final result with `endl`.  Similar to `B_Luntik_and_Subsequences.cpp`,  the commented-out code at the top of the file, containing many mathematical functions, remained unchanged throughout the edits.


## 10:42:15 PM
The log shows a single code file, `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp`, updated on June 5th, 2025, at 9:43:13 PM.  The code is a C++ program that appears to be designed for competitive programming.  It includes numerous commented-out code snippets for functionalities such as sieve of Eratosthenes (for finding primes), calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and combinations (nCr).  These commented sections suggest an iterative development process, where different approaches were explored but ultimately not used in the final version.  The `CutiePie()` function is defined but empty, indicating a placeholder for the core problem-solving logic.  The `main` function reads an integer `qt` representing the number of test cases, but the actual problem-solving is delegated to the currently empty `CutiePie()` function which is called `qt` number of times.  The code also includes standard input/output optimization.


## 11:42:19 PM
The log shows development of two C++ programs: `A_Mocha_and_Math.cpp` and `A_Exciting_Bets.cpp`.

`A_Mocha_and_Math.cpp`:  This file underwent significant changes between 10:42 PM and 10:43 PM.  Initially, the `CutiePie` function was incomplete.  Over a series of quick edits, the function was fleshed out to take in `n` integers, and then it calculates the maximum value obtained by XORing all possible sub-arrays.  The final version, achieved by 10:43:46 PM, efficiently computes this using bitwise XOR operations.  The commented-out code suggests exploration of various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) which were ultimately not used in the solution.

`A_Exciting_Bets.cpp`: Development on this file spanned from 10:53 PM to 11:17 PM. The initial commits show an incomplete `CutiePie` function.  The program was developed to solve a problem involving two integers, `a` and `b`. The core logic involves finding the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, and then calculating a secondary value based on the remainder when one integer is divided by the `gcd`.  There was a significant amount of refinement and debugging in the `CutiePie` function from  11:08 PM onwards. The final version, completed at 11:17:14 PM, correctly handles the case where `a` equals `b` and efficiently determines the `gcd` and the secondary value.


Both files share a common header, including macros like `#define int long long` and `#define MOD 1000000007`, as well as commented-out sieve and divisor calculation code. This suggests a common template or boilerplate was used for both programs, potentially for competitive programming.
