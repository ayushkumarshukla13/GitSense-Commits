# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 8:44:08 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `A_Mainak_and_Array.cpp` and `B_NIT_Destroys_the_Universe.cpp`.  `A_Mainak_and_Array.cpp` underwent significant changes between 7:47 AM and 7:53 AM, primarily focusing on refining a function called `CutiePie`. This function reads an array, calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements and the difference between the last and first elements, and then outputs the maximum of these differences.  Initially, the code was incomplete, with errors in variable initialization and loop conditions.  These were progressively corrected, culminating in a complete and functional solution. The final version includes a conditional statement that optimizes the solution when the minimum or maximum element is at the start or end of the vector.

`B_NIT_Destroys_the_Universe.cpp` saw development from 8:04 AM to 8:09 AM.  The `CutiePie` function in this file takes an array as input and determines whether the array contains zeros between the first and last non-zero elements. If such zeros are present, the output is 2; otherwise, the output is 1.  If all elements are zero, the output is 0.  The code's evolution involved adding input reading, array sorting, and implementing the zero check logic. The final version is clean and addresses the problem statement directly.


Both files share a common structure:  they include numerous commented-out code snippets for sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculations, suggesting these were initially considered but ultimately not implemented in these specific problems.  Both also use the `CutiePie` function name, implying a coding style preference or a naming convention. The main function in both files reads the number of test cases and iterates through them, calling the `CutiePie` function for each.  This pattern suggests the code is designed to handle multiple input sets efficiently.


## 9:44:07 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`B_Make_It_Increasing.cpp`) designed to solve a problem involving increasing integer sequences.  The primary changes occur within the `CutiePie()` function, which processes an input vector of integers.

Early timestamps (8:47 AM) show the initial setup of the code, including the inclusion of standard libraries,  definitions, and commented-out code related to sieve methods and divisor calculations (these are not used in the final version). The `CutiePie()` function is initially incomplete.

Subsequent updates (between 8:47 AM and 8:49 AM) focus on iterating through the input vector (`a` and later `v`) from right to left, adding conditional logic (`if` statements) to check for non-increasing elements.  The algorithm's core logic is developed during this period. A variable `ct` is introduced to count operations.

Between 8:49 AM and 9:00 AM, the `while` loop is refined to handle multiple consecutive non-increasing elements. The condition `v[i] < v[i-1]` is consistently used.  `v[i-1]` is repeatedly halved (`v[i-1]/=2`) within the `while` loop.

From 9:00 AM onwards, minor refinements to the conditional statements are made, primarily adjusting the `if` condition to `v[i] <= v[i-1]` and refining the check for edge cases where `v[i-1]` becomes 0 within the inner loop.  The handling of the case where the sequence cannot be made increasing (`cout<<-1<<endl; return;`) is also added and adjusted in several versions to ensure it handles edge cases correctly.

At approximately 9:30 AM, the code becomes stable in structure, though minor corrections to the edge case handling continue.

Finally, around 9:40 AM a significant change occurs. The input vector `v` is initialized using `push_back`, rather than declaring its size in advance.  The loop structure in `CutiePie()` changes to iterate from `n-2` to 0, suggesting a potential algorithmic optimization.  This section includes some unfinished code, but it ultimately settles into a version that processes the vector in reverse order to check for and correct decreasing elements by repeatedly halving the preceding element while it remains greater than or equal to the current element.

The final code iterates through the input vector from right to left, and if an element is less than or equal to the previous element, it repeatedly divides the previous element by 2 until the increasing order is restored or the previous element reaches 0. The count of these divisions is tracked and outputted.  The program correctly handles cases where making the sequence increasing is impossible and returns -1 accordingly.
