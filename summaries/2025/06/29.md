# Activity Summary for 6/29/2025

## 9:54:16 AM
The log shows iterative development of a C++ function `CutiePie`.  The file `B_AND_Sorting.cpp` is repeatedly modified between 8:55 AM and 9:17 AM on June 29, 2025.

Initially, `CutiePie` was a stub function.  Changes between 8:55 AM and 8:56 AM involved adding code to read `n` integers into a vector `v`.  Further modifications until 9:00 AM focused on calculating the maximum value of `v[i] & i` (bitwise AND of vector element and its index) or `v[i] & (i+1)`, then outputting this maximum value.  There was some experimentation with the index used in the bitwise AND operation.

Between 9:08 AM and 9:11 AM, the algorithm changed significantly. The goal shifted to calculating the bitwise AND of all elements in the vector `v`, with an initial value of `ans` set to 0 or 1.  A conditional statement (`if(v[i]!=i)`) was added at 9:11 AM, modifying the bitwise AND calculation only if `v[i]` is not equal to `i`. This condition was refined, and by 9:17 AM, the initial value of `ans` was changed to `(1LL << 32) - 1`, which is likely to represent a bitmask.  The overall logic throughout these changes focuses on bitwise AND operations on the input vector.  The commented-out code suggests earlier explorations of sieve methods and divisor calculations, which are ultimately not used in the final version.


## 10:54:21 AM
The log shows development on two C++ files: `B_A_Perfectly_Balanced_String.cpp` and `F_Eating_Candies.cpp`.

`B_A_Perfectly_Balanced_String.cpp`: This file underwent numerous revisions between 10:11:56 AM and 10:14:34 AM on June 29, 2025.  The core change involved the `CutiePie` function, which initially was empty.  The function was progressively developed to read a string from input (`cin >> s`), use a `set` to track unique characters, and check if the string is "perfectly balanced". The logic was refined iteratively, with the addition of a `break` statement to exit the loop early, along with conditionals to determine whether the string meets the balance criteria, and finally outputting "YES" or "NO" based on that criteria.  The commented-out code suggests the initial intention may have involved number theory functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr),  but these were ultimately unused in the final version.

`F_Eating_Candies.cpp`:  This file was modified between 10:17:51 AM and 10:53:49 AM on June 29, 2025. The main development occurred within the `CutiePie` function. It started as an empty function and evolved to read an integer `n` representing the number of candies, followed by `n` integers representing the number of candies of each type. The code then calculates prefix and suffix sums of the candy counts, uses a map to store frequencies of those sums, and finally determines and outputs a result based on these sums. The final version (10:53:49 AM) calculates and prints the sum of indices `a` and `b` plus 1, representing the solution to some problem concerning the prefix and suffix sums and their intersections.  Similar to the other file, numerous commented-out code sections relating to number theory functions were present but ultimately discarded.


## 11:54:19 AM
The log shows the evolution of two C++ files: `F_Eating_Candies.cpp` and `B_Subtract_Operation.cpp`.

`F_Eating_Candies.cpp` underwent extensive modification between 10:54 AM and 11:06 AM.  The core functionality involves processing an input array (`v`) to find indices `a` and `b` such that the prefix sum at `a` equals the suffix sum at `b`.  Early versions included debugging print statements for `pre` (prefix sum array) and `suf` (suffix sum array).  The condition for finding `a` and `b` was refined across multiple commits, with corrections to the index calculations and the final output (the sum `a + b + 2` was adjusted to `a + b`).  A significant change at 11:05 AM involved printing the map `m` (used to store suffix sums and their indices), which is likely for debugging purposes. A final version adds a check for edge cases where `a` and `b` are both -1 indicating no solution, outputting 0 in that scenario. The commented-out code suggests explorations of sieve methods, divisor calculations, and factorial/power functions that were ultimately unused in the final version.

`B_Subtract_Operation.cpp` was developed between 11:22 AM and 11:24 AM. This file takes two inputs `n` and `k`, and checks if there exists an element in the input array `v` such that subtracting `k` from this element results in an element that is also present in `v`.  The initial versions were incomplete.  The final version efficiently uses a map `m` to store array elements as keys and their presence as boolean values.  The core logic iterates through the array, checking the map for the existence of `v[i] - k`. If found, it prints "YES" and exits; otherwise, it prints "NO" after iterating through the entire array.  This file also contains commented-out code similar to `F_Eating_Candies.cpp`, which appears to be template code for common mathematical operations.
