# Activity Summary for 6/29/2025

## 9:54:16 AM
The log shows iterative development of a C++ function `CutiePie`.  The file `B_AND_Sorting.cpp` is repeatedly modified between 8:55 AM and 9:17 AM on June 29, 2025.

Initially, `CutiePie` was a stub function.  Changes between 8:55 AM and 8:56 AM involved adding code to read `n` integers into a vector `v`.  Further modifications until 9:00 AM focused on calculating the maximum value of `v[i] & i` (bitwise AND of vector element and its index) or `v[i] & (i+1)`, then outputting this maximum value.  There was some experimentation with the index used in the bitwise AND operation.

Between 9:08 AM and 9:11 AM, the algorithm changed significantly. The goal shifted to calculating the bitwise AND of all elements in the vector `v`, with an initial value of `ans` set to 0 or 1.  A conditional statement (`if(v[i]!=i)`) was added at 9:11 AM, modifying the bitwise AND calculation only if `v[i]` is not equal to `i`. This condition was refined, and by 9:17 AM, the initial value of `ans` was changed to `(1LL << 32) - 1`, which is likely to represent a bitmask.  The overall logic throughout these changes focuses on bitwise AND operations on the input vector.  The commented-out code suggests earlier explorations of sieve methods and divisor calculations, which are ultimately not used in the final version.
