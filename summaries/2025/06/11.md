# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 6:46:38 AM
The log shows modifications to `C_Cool_Partition.cpp` between 12:55:20 AM and 12:56:34 AM on June 11, 2025.  The file contains a C++ program.  The core changes center around the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was empty.  At 12:55:46 AM, it was updated to count the number of divisors of an input integer *n*.  At 12:55:56 AM, the code was improved to print the count of divisors.  A final modification at 12:56:34 AM introduced a seemingly erroneous `else{ break; }` statement within the divisor counting loop, causing the function to potentially terminate prematurely and incorrectly for some input values.  The rest of the code (commented-out sieve, power, factorial, modular inverse, and nCr functions) remained unchanged throughout the log.  The main function consistently reads an integer `qt` (always 1 in the given log) and calls `CutiePie()` `qt` times.


## 8:49:33 AM
The log shows development of two C++ files: `B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` and `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp`.

`B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` underwent extensive modification between 8:17 AM and 8:35 AM.  The core change involved developing a function `CutiePie` that processes input integers (`n` and `x`). The logic within `CutiePie`  focuses on handling even and odd numbers, specifically using modulo operations (`%`) and conditional statements to determine and output a result based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 and 4.  Several intermediate commits show incremental progress towards a complete solution, with many edits focusing on correcting conditional logic and output statements.  The final version (8:35 AM) presents a complete solution to a problem that likely involves determining a final value based on the parity of input integers.

`B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp` was worked on between 8:37 AM and 8:43 AM. This file aims to solve a problem where an integer needs to be made divisible by 25.  The code extracts digits from the input integer (`n`) and then attempts to find combinations of digits that, when forming a two-digit number, are divisible by 25 (i.e., containing either 00, 25, 50, or 75). The final version (8:43 AM) uses nested loops to check for the presence of 0 or 5 in various positions and potentially uses those to determine a final value. The comments in both files suggest that the developer initially planned to implement several other algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes, calculating divisors, etc.) but ultimately did not use them in the final solution.


## 9:49:35 AM
The log shows development across several C++ files, all using similar boilerplate code including macros (`#define int long long`, `#define MOD 1000000007`, `const int N = 1e6 + 10`), and commented-out sections related to sieve and divisor calculations.  A `CutiePie` function is consistently used across all files but its implementation changes significantly based on the problem being solved.

**File: `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:12:18 AM - 9:12:53 AM)**

This file underwent several minor revisions between 9:12:18 AM and 9:12:53 AM. The primary change within `CutiePie` was correcting the logic to find the minimum index where a number can be made divisible by 25 by checking combinations of 0, 2, 5, and 7,  and correctly outputting the result. The initial versions had logic errors in determining and outputting the `ans` variable.  The final version added `<<endl;` to properly format the output.


**File: `B_Bad_Boy.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:17:40 AM - 9:18:31 AM)**

This file tracked the implementation of the `CutiePie` function for a different problem. The edits show a progressive implementation, starting with an empty `cout` statement and incrementally adding output values (1, 1, a, b) based on input variables a, b, c, and d. The complete code was achieved within 1 minute, between 9:17:40 AM and 9:18:31 AM.


**File: `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:32:13 AM - 9:47:33 AM)**

This file represents the most extensive development effort, spanning approximately 15 minutes. The `CutiePie` function's evolution is substantial:

* Initial versions contained incomplete function definitions.
* Input reading and vector creation were implemented step by step.
*  Significant changes involved reversing the input vector and then iteratively calculating and printing a sum based on medians. There were many iterations involving correcting the logic for calculating the sum of medians, adjusting loop conditions, and handling edge cases.  Incorrect indexing and loop termination were addressed over several commits. The final version correctly computes the sum of medians and prints the output.

In summary, the code log demonstrates the iterative development of three distinct C++ programs, all using a consistent code structure but with evolving function implementations.  The `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` file shows the most complex and iterative development process.


## 10:49:27 AM
The log shows modifications to the `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` file between 9:49 AM and 9:58 AM on June 11, 2025.  The core functionality of the code, which calculates the sum of medians from input, remains consistent throughout the edits.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the `CutiePie()` function.


Initially, the code correctly calculated the sum but lacked outputting intermediate values (the medians themselves). Subsequent revisions (between 9:50 AM and 9:53 AM) added the printing of each median value during the summation process within the `while` loop in `CutiePie()`.  A minor error in the loop increment (`q++`) was added and then removed.  Around 9:52 AM, a line `v.push_back(0);` was removed from the `CutiePie()` function. This line was seemingly unnecessary as the vector `v` was already correctly sized. The final change at 9:58 AM reverted the code to the state prior to the printing of intermediate values, but with the unnecessary line removed, thus maintaining a cleaner version with only the final sum printed.

The commented-out code sections, including sieve, caldiv, and mathematical functions (factorial, power, modInverse, nCr), were consistently present across all revisions and remain unused in the final version.  This suggests that these components may be remnants from previous versions or planned additions which were never implemented.


## 11:03:05 AM
On June 11th, 2025, several files related to user authentication and authorization were updated.  The `userAuthent.js` file, modified at 10:14:15 AM, contains controllers for user registration (`register`, `adminRegister`), login (`login`), and logout (`logout`).  These functions utilize bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for token generation, and Redis for token blocking in the logout functionality.


The `userMiddleware.js` (10:14:54 AM) and `adminMiddleware.js` (10:15:02 AM) files implement middleware for user and admin authentication respectively.  Both middleware functions verify JWT tokens, check for token presence in Redis's block list, and fetch user data from the database. The key difference is that `adminMiddleware.js` additionally verifies that the user's role is 'admin'.

Between 10:47:24 AM and 10:53:02 AM, the `redis.js` file underwent multiple revisions. These changes primarily involved updating the Redis connection string, specifically the host and port,  to point to a different Redis instance. Finally at 10:53:02 AM, the `redis.js` file was updated to use the correct Redis connection string, removing the redundant code.  The final version uses `process.env.REDIS_PASS` for the password.


The `.env` file was modified multiple times between 10:54:35 AM and 10:59:46 AM to add and mask the `REDIS_PASS` environment variable.  The final value was masked as `*******`.  Other environment variables like `PORT`, `DB_CONNECT_STRING`, and `JWT_KEY` remained unchanged.  The repeated masking of `REDIS_PASS` suggests a focus on security and the intention to keep the Redis password confidential.


## 12:03:05 PM
The log shows modifications to configuration and authentication middleware within the Codenopsis project.

`redis.js`: This file underwent several changes between 11:20 AM and 11:28 AM.  Initially, the `REDIS_PASS` environment variable was not used (commented out) then it was uncommented and the Redis connection configuration changed twice: first, the host and port were updated from `redis-16525.crce179...` and port 16525 to `redis-11573.crce206...` and port 11573. Finally, comments were added to the `redis.js` file, suggesting a change in the user account used for Redis.  This indicates a shift in Redis connection parameters, possibly due to a migration or update of the Redis instance.

`.env`: The `REDIS_PASS` value in the `.env` file was updated at 11:24 AM. This correlates directly with the changes in `redis.js`, confirming the update of Redis credentials.

`userMiddleware.js`: A significant update occurred at 11:44 AM. This file introduces middleware for user authentication using JWT and Redis. The middleware verifies JWT tokens, fetches user data, and checks if the token is present in a Redis blocklist (`token:${token}`). If the token is blocked, an error is returned.  This indicates the implementation of a robust authentication mechanism incorporating token blacklisting for security purposes.


## 1:49:28 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` and `B_Multiply_by_2_divide_by_6.cpp`.  Both files utilize similar header inclusions and macro definitions, suggesting a common coding style or project.  Many commented-out code sections are present in both files, related to sieving, calculating divisors, and other mathematical functions; these were likely explored but ultimately unused in the final versions.


`B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` underwent significant changes between 1:04 PM and 1:06 PM. The core logic of the program involves reading input values (`s` and `n`), calculating an intermediate value (`bhak`), reading a vector `v` of these values, and then iteratively calculating a sum (`ans`) based on the values in `v` and a pointer `po`,  This calculation involves updating `po` using the expression `po -= (s/2 + 1)`.  The final version outputs the calculated sum. The initial versions contained incomplete or incorrect code within the `CutiePie()` function which was progressively refined until the final version at 1:06:23 PM and then a slight change in the logic of update of po at 1:07:18 PM and finally  corrected at 1:07:30 PM where the vector is properly initialized.

`B_Multiply_by_2_divide_by_6.cpp` was developed between 1:16 PM and 1:24 PM.  The program counts the number of times a number `n` can be divided by 2 and 3 (`ct2`, `ct3`). The logic checks if the resulting number (`m`) is 1, and if not, or if `ct2` exceeds `ct3`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value based on the difference between `ct2` and `ct3`, specifically `qt + min(ct2, ct3)` initially, then corrected to `qt + max(ct2, ct3)`. The final, correct version efficiently handles the division checks using `while` loops with conditions and improves readability.


## 2:49:26 PM
The log shows modifications to the file `M_Minimum_LCM.cpp` between 1:50 PM and 2:00 PM on June 11, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `CutiePie()` function, which appears to be designed to find two factors of an input number `n` that minimize their least common multiple.

Initially, the `CutiePie()` function was incomplete.  Over several iterations (between 1:50 PM and 1:51 PM), the code within the `for` loop was progressively refined, ultimately aiming to find a divisor of `n`.  The code was also debugged; an uninitialized variable `ans` was added and initialized to 0.  The output was also added, printing `ans` and `n-ans`, which seems to be an attempt to find two factors that add up to `n`.

Around 1:51 PM,  the loop's condition changed from `i<=()` to `(i*i)<=(n)`, which is an optimization to only check up to the square root of n.  Between 1:51 PM and 1:58 PM further debugging and refinement took place,  with a `break` statement added to the loop to exit after finding the first divisor.  The loop's starting value `i` was changed from 1 to 2, as 1 is always a divisor. This change is significant in the logic of finding the minimal LCM, ensuring that trivial divisors are not considered. Finally, the initial value of `ans` was corrected to 1 instead of 0 at 2:00PM to handle cases where the input `n` is a prime number.


The commented-out code sections suggest the file originally contained, or was intended to contain, implementations for a sieve of Eratosthenes (for finding prime numbers),  a function to calculate the number of divisors of a number, and functions for factorial, power, modular inverse and nCr calculations. These were not used in the final version of the code.


## 5:49:28 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program (`A_Red_Versus_Blue.cpp`) between 5:01 PM and 5:05 PM on June 11, 2025.  The core functionality involves reading three integers (n, r, b) and generating an output string.

Initially, the `CutiePie` function was empty.  Over the next few minutes, it was progressively developed to perform the following steps:

1. **Input:** The code first takes in three integer inputs: `n`, `r`, and `b`. (5:01:11 PM)

2. **Calculation:** It calculates `a` as the integer division of `r` by `(b+1)` and `c` as the remainder of `r` divided by `(b+1)`. (5:01:55 PM)

3. **Output Generation:** The program then iterates `b` times. In each iteration, it prints `a` 'R' characters.  After the loop, it prints `c` 'R' characters. Finally, it prints 'B' character and remaining 'R' characters (5:03:48 PM - 5:05:34 PM). This section underwent the most changes, with numerous edits correcting logic and output formatting.  The final version correctly handles the remainder and outputs a string of 'R' and 'B' characters based on the input.  (5:05:34 PM)

The commented-out code suggests that the programmer initially intended to include functionalities for sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculations. However, these were not used in the final version of the program.  The code consistently uses `long long` integers (`#define int long long`) indicating the program likely handles larger numerical values.


## 8:49:35 PM
The log shows a series of edits to two C++ files, `Number_Reduction.cpp` and `Light_All.cpp`, between 8:04 PM and 8:49 PM on June 11, 2025.

`Number_Reduction.cpp` received only one update at 8:04 PM.  This file contains a simple program that takes an integer as input and outputs either 1 or 3 based on whether the input is divisible by 3. The code includes numerous commented-out sections that suggest previously explored or abandoned functionalities, including sieve methods for prime checking and divisor calculations.

`Light_All.cpp` underwent a significant number of modifications between 8:06 PM and 8:49 PM. Initially, the code was incomplete, with a `cin >> s;` statement in the `CutiePie` function without a full implementation. Subsequent changes involved adding `cin >> s;` to read a string, then experimenting with string manipulation using `s.find()`.  The objective of the code appears to be checking for the presence or absence of the substring "010" or "000" within the input string 's'. The core logic evolved from checking for the substrings directly to counting the occurrences of '0' and '1' characters and applying a conditional logic based on the counts and subsequence patterns.  The final version at 8:48 PM appears to be incomplete.  It checks for the presence of "000" and "010" substrings but lacks a final output. The final complete version checks whether the number of zeros is greater than the number of ones; if so it prints "NO", otherwise it checks for the substrings "000", "0100" and "0110" and prints "NO" if found otherwise "YES".


The common element across both files is the presence of extensively commented-out code blocks related to number theory functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, combinations) and sieve of Eratosthenes.  These were likely explored initially but ultimately deemed unnecessary for the simplified programs' current functionality.


## 9:49:35 PM
The log shows the evolution of two C++ files: `Parry_It_Easy.cpp` and `Min_Max_Deletion.cpp`.

**Parry_It_Easy.cpp:** This file underwent extensive modification between 8:50 PM and 9:23 PM on June 11, 2025.  Initially, the code contained a `CutiePie` function that read two integers `n` and `l`, and two vectors `a` and `b`. The function had a flaw: it returned 0 if any element in `a` was greater than `l`, but didn't calculate any result otherwise.


Subsequent edits focused on refining the `CutiePie` function.  Changes involved:

* Adding and modifying `mini` and `maxi` variables to find the minimum and maximum values within vector `a`.
* Correcting the initialization of `mini` to `INT_MAX` and `maxi` to `INT_MIN`.
* Modifying the logic to calculate the answer `ans` based on the difference between `l` and the maximum value in `a` and also using `b` vector.
* The final version (9:23 PM) calculates `ans` by iterating through `b` and checking if `l` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`. If true, `ans` increments and `l` decrements. The final `ans` is printed.



**Min_Max_Deletion.cpp:**  This file was modified between 9:34 PM and 9:45 PM on June 11, 2025. The initial code was a stub of a `CutiePie` function that only read input.

Edits involved:

* Completing the `CutiePie` function to handle queries. It takes `n` and `q` as input, reads a vector `v`, and then processes `q` queries. Each query updates an element of `v` at a specific index. The function calculates the sum of minimum values of consecutive pairs in `v` after each query.
*  The final version efficiently updates the sum after each query, avoiding recalculation of the entire sum. The changes at 9:40 PM and later optimize the code for better efficiency in updating the sum rather than recalculating it every time.


A common pattern in both files is the presence of commented-out code, likely representing earlier iterations or explorations of different algorithms.  Both files also use the `#define int long long` preprocessor directive, suggesting a need to handle large integer values.


## 11:56:28 PM
The log shows development activity on a coding platform application named "Codenopsis" between 11:28 PM and 11:34 PM on June 11, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on user authentication, problem creation, and middleware.

**`db.js` (11:28:02 PM):** This file establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, relying on a connection string from environment variables.

**`userAuthent.js` (multiple updates between 11:28:42 PM and 11:33:03 PM):** This controller handles user registration and login.  Significant changes involved implementing user registration (`register`), login (`login`), and logout (`logout`) functionalities. The `logout` function now uses Redis to blacklist tokens for enhanced security.  The `adminRegister` function was also added for admin user creation.  The most notable changes were removing commented-out code,  and resolving a bug where `User.create` wasn't called in `adminRegister`.

**`userProblem.js` (updates at 11:29:08 PM, 11:33:13 PM and 11:33:24 PM):** This controller handles problem creation. Updates simplified the code by removing commented-out example code and clarifying the submission process. The primary functionality involves creating a problem with details such as title, description, difficulty, test cases, start code, and reference solution. It uses the `problemUtility.js` to handle language ID mapping and batch submissions to Judge0-CE.

**`adminMiddleware.js` (11:29:22 PM and 11:33:34 PM):** This middleware verifies admin user tokens and checks a Redis blacklist for blocked tokens before granting access. The 11:33:34 PM update removed redundant code for checking `_id` existence in the payload.

**`userMiddleware.js` (11:29:29 PM and 11:33:44 PM):**  Similar to `adminMiddleware.js`, this verifies user tokens and checks for blocked tokens.  The structure is nearly identical to `adminMiddleware.js`, suggesting a potential opportunity for refactoring to share code.

**`problem.js` (11:29:41 PM):** This Mongoose schema defines the structure for problem data in the database, including test cases and reference solutions in multiple languages.  The file includes example data as a constant.

**`user.js` (11:29:48 PM):** This Mongoose schema defines the structure for user data, including user roles and timestamps.

**`problemCreator.js` (11:30:00 PM):** This defines the routes for problem creation, updating, deleting, and retrieving problems, all requiring admin middleware.

**`userAuth.js` (11:30:06 PM and 11:34:22 PM):** This defines the routes for user authentication, utilizing middleware to protect the logout route and admin registration route. The final update at 11:34:22 PM removed commented-out route code.

**`problemUtility.js` (11:30:36 PM, 11:30:47 PM and 11:34:33 PM):** This utility module provides functions for mapping language names to IDs and submitting code batches to Judge0-CE for evaluation. The multiple timestamps indicate potential debugging or minor adjustments to the code.

**`validator.js` (11:30:54 PM and 11:34:42 PM):** This module contains a validation function ensuring the presence of required fields and validates email and password format. The multiple timestamps likely reflect minor edits.

**`index.js` (11:31:04 PM):** This is the main application file, setting up the Express server and initiating database and Redis connections.

**`package-lock.json` (11:31:21 PM):** This file shows a snapshot of the project's dependencies and their versions.

**`package.json` (11:31:27 PM):** This file describes the project, its dependencies, scripts, and metadata.


In summary, the log shows the development process of a significant chunk of the Codenopsis application focusing on authentication and problem creation and handling features.  There's a consistent use of JWT for authentication, Redis for token blacklisting, and Judge0-CE for code evaluation.  The repeated modifications to `userAuthent.js` suggest an iterative development process, involving bug fixes and improvements.  The similar structure of the middleware files presents an opportunity for code consolidation.
