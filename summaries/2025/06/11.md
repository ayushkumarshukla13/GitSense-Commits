# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 6:46:38 AM
The log shows modifications to `C_Cool_Partition.cpp` between 12:55:20 AM and 12:56:34 AM on June 11, 2025.  The file contains a C++ program.  The core changes center around the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was empty.  At 12:55:46 AM, it was updated to count the number of divisors of an input integer *n*.  At 12:55:56 AM, the code was improved to print the count of divisors.  A final modification at 12:56:34 AM introduced a seemingly erroneous `else{ break; }` statement within the divisor counting loop, causing the function to potentially terminate prematurely and incorrectly for some input values.  The rest of the code (commented-out sieve, power, factorial, modular inverse, and nCr functions) remained unchanged throughout the log.  The main function consistently reads an integer `qt` (always 1 in the given log) and calls `CutiePie()` `qt` times.


## 8:49:33 AM
The log shows development of two C++ files: `B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` and `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp`.

`B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` underwent extensive modification between 8:17 AM and 8:35 AM.  The core change involved developing a function `CutiePie` that processes input integers (`n` and `x`). The logic within `CutiePie`  focuses on handling even and odd numbers, specifically using modulo operations (`%`) and conditional statements to determine and output a result based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 and 4.  Several intermediate commits show incremental progress towards a complete solution, with many edits focusing on correcting conditional logic and output statements.  The final version (8:35 AM) presents a complete solution to a problem that likely involves determining a final value based on the parity of input integers.

`B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp` was worked on between 8:37 AM and 8:43 AM. This file aims to solve a problem where an integer needs to be made divisible by 25.  The code extracts digits from the input integer (`n`) and then attempts to find combinations of digits that, when forming a two-digit number, are divisible by 25 (i.e., containing either 00, 25, 50, or 75). The final version (8:43 AM) uses nested loops to check for the presence of 0 or 5 in various positions and potentially uses those to determine a final value. The comments in both files suggest that the developer initially planned to implement several other algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes, calculating divisors, etc.) but ultimately did not use them in the final solution.


## 9:49:35 AM
The log shows development across several C++ files, all using similar boilerplate code including macros (`#define int long long`, `#define MOD 1000000007`, `const int N = 1e6 + 10`), and commented-out sections related to sieve and divisor calculations.  A `CutiePie` function is consistently used across all files but its implementation changes significantly based on the problem being solved.

**File: `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:12:18 AM - 9:12:53 AM)**

This file underwent several minor revisions between 9:12:18 AM and 9:12:53 AM. The primary change within `CutiePie` was correcting the logic to find the minimum index where a number can be made divisible by 25 by checking combinations of 0, 2, 5, and 7,  and correctly outputting the result. The initial versions had logic errors in determining and outputting the `ans` variable.  The final version added `<<endl;` to properly format the output.


**File: `B_Bad_Boy.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:17:40 AM - 9:18:31 AM)**

This file tracked the implementation of the `CutiePie` function for a different problem. The edits show a progressive implementation, starting with an empty `cout` statement and incrementally adding output values (1, 1, a, b) based on input variables a, b, c, and d. The complete code was achieved within 1 minute, between 9:17:40 AM and 9:18:31 AM.


**File: `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:32:13 AM - 9:47:33 AM)**

This file represents the most extensive development effort, spanning approximately 15 minutes. The `CutiePie` function's evolution is substantial:

* Initial versions contained incomplete function definitions.
* Input reading and vector creation were implemented step by step.
*  Significant changes involved reversing the input vector and then iteratively calculating and printing a sum based on medians. There were many iterations involving correcting the logic for calculating the sum of medians, adjusting loop conditions, and handling edge cases.  Incorrect indexing and loop termination were addressed over several commits. The final version correctly computes the sum of medians and prints the output.

In summary, the code log demonstrates the iterative development of three distinct C++ programs, all using a consistent code structure but with evolving function implementations.  The `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` file shows the most complex and iterative development process.


## 10:49:27 AM
The log shows modifications to the `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` file between 9:49 AM and 9:58 AM on June 11, 2025.  The core functionality of the code, which calculates the sum of medians from input, remains consistent throughout the edits.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the `CutiePie()` function.


Initially, the code correctly calculated the sum but lacked outputting intermediate values (the medians themselves). Subsequent revisions (between 9:50 AM and 9:53 AM) added the printing of each median value during the summation process within the `while` loop in `CutiePie()`.  A minor error in the loop increment (`q++`) was added and then removed.  Around 9:52 AM, a line `v.push_back(0);` was removed from the `CutiePie()` function. This line was seemingly unnecessary as the vector `v` was already correctly sized. The final change at 9:58 AM reverted the code to the state prior to the printing of intermediate values, but with the unnecessary line removed, thus maintaining a cleaner version with only the final sum printed.

The commented-out code sections, including sieve, caldiv, and mathematical functions (factorial, power, modInverse, nCr), were consistently present across all revisions and remain unused in the final version.  This suggests that these components may be remnants from previous versions or planned additions which were never implemented.


## 11:03:05 AM
On June 11th, 2025, several files related to user authentication and authorization were updated.  The `userAuthent.js` file, modified at 10:14:15 AM, contains controllers for user registration (`register`, `adminRegister`), login (`login`), and logout (`logout`).  These functions utilize bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for token generation, and Redis for token blocking in the logout functionality.


The `userMiddleware.js` (10:14:54 AM) and `adminMiddleware.js` (10:15:02 AM) files implement middleware for user and admin authentication respectively.  Both middleware functions verify JWT tokens, check for token presence in Redis's block list, and fetch user data from the database. The key difference is that `adminMiddleware.js` additionally verifies that the user's role is 'admin'.

Between 10:47:24 AM and 10:53:02 AM, the `redis.js` file underwent multiple revisions. These changes primarily involved updating the Redis connection string, specifically the host and port,  to point to a different Redis instance. Finally at 10:53:02 AM, the `redis.js` file was updated to use the correct Redis connection string, removing the redundant code.  The final version uses `process.env.REDIS_PASS` for the password.


The `.env` file was modified multiple times between 10:54:35 AM and 10:59:46 AM to add and mask the `REDIS_PASS` environment variable.  The final value was masked as `*******`.  Other environment variables like `PORT`, `DB_CONNECT_STRING`, and `JWT_KEY` remained unchanged.  The repeated masking of `REDIS_PASS` suggests a focus on security and the intention to keep the Redis password confidential.


## 12:03:05 PM
The log shows modifications to configuration and authentication middleware within the Codenopsis project.

`redis.js`: This file underwent several changes between 11:20 AM and 11:28 AM.  Initially, the `REDIS_PASS` environment variable was not used (commented out) then it was uncommented and the Redis connection configuration changed twice: first, the host and port were updated from `redis-16525.crce179...` and port 16525 to `redis-11573.crce206...` and port 11573. Finally, comments were added to the `redis.js` file, suggesting a change in the user account used for Redis.  This indicates a shift in Redis connection parameters, possibly due to a migration or update of the Redis instance.

`.env`: The `REDIS_PASS` value in the `.env` file was updated at 11:24 AM. This correlates directly with the changes in `redis.js`, confirming the update of Redis credentials.

`userMiddleware.js`: A significant update occurred at 11:44 AM. This file introduces middleware for user authentication using JWT and Redis. The middleware verifies JWT tokens, fetches user data, and checks if the token is present in a Redis blocklist (`token:${token}`). If the token is blocked, an error is returned.  This indicates the implementation of a robust authentication mechanism incorporating token blacklisting for security purposes.
