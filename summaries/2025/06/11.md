# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 6:46:38 AM
The log shows modifications to `C_Cool_Partition.cpp` between 12:55:20 AM and 12:56:34 AM on June 11, 2025.  The file contains a C++ program.  The core changes center around the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was empty.  At 12:55:46 AM, it was updated to count the number of divisors of an input integer *n*.  At 12:55:56 AM, the code was improved to print the count of divisors.  A final modification at 12:56:34 AM introduced a seemingly erroneous `else{ break; }` statement within the divisor counting loop, causing the function to potentially terminate prematurely and incorrectly for some input values.  The rest of the code (commented-out sieve, power, factorial, modular inverse, and nCr functions) remained unchanged throughout the log.  The main function consistently reads an integer `qt` (always 1 in the given log) and calls `CutiePie()` `qt` times.
