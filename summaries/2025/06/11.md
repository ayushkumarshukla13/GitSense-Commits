# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 6:46:38 AM
The log shows modifications to `C_Cool_Partition.cpp` between 12:55:20 AM and 12:56:34 AM on June 11, 2025.  The file contains a C++ program.  The core changes center around the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was empty.  At 12:55:46 AM, it was updated to count the number of divisors of an input integer *n*.  At 12:55:56 AM, the code was improved to print the count of divisors.  A final modification at 12:56:34 AM introduced a seemingly erroneous `else{ break; }` statement within the divisor counting loop, causing the function to potentially terminate prematurely and incorrectly for some input values.  The rest of the code (commented-out sieve, power, factorial, modular inverse, and nCr functions) remained unchanged throughout the log.  The main function consistently reads an integer `qt` (always 1 in the given log) and calls `CutiePie()` `qt` times.


## 8:49:33 AM
The log shows development of two C++ files: `B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` and `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp`.

`B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` underwent extensive modification between 8:17 AM and 8:35 AM.  The core change involved developing a function `CutiePie` that processes input integers (`n` and `x`). The logic within `CutiePie`  focuses on handling even and odd numbers, specifically using modulo operations (`%`) and conditional statements to determine and output a result based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 and 4.  Several intermediate commits show incremental progress towards a complete solution, with many edits focusing on correcting conditional logic and output statements.  The final version (8:35 AM) presents a complete solution to a problem that likely involves determining a final value based on the parity of input integers.

`B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp` was worked on between 8:37 AM and 8:43 AM. This file aims to solve a problem where an integer needs to be made divisible by 25.  The code extracts digits from the input integer (`n`) and then attempts to find combinations of digits that, when forming a two-digit number, are divisible by 25 (i.e., containing either 00, 25, 50, or 75). The final version (8:43 AM) uses nested loops to check for the presence of 0 or 5 in various positions and potentially uses those to determine a final value. The comments in both files suggest that the developer initially planned to implement several other algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes, calculating divisors, etc.) but ultimately did not use them in the final solution.


## 9:49:35 AM
The log shows development across several C++ files, all using similar boilerplate code including macros (`#define int long long`, `#define MOD 1000000007`, `const int N = 1e6 + 10`), and commented-out sections related to sieve and divisor calculations.  A `CutiePie` function is consistently used across all files but its implementation changes significantly based on the problem being solved.

**File: `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:12:18 AM - 9:12:53 AM)**

This file underwent several minor revisions between 9:12:18 AM and 9:12:53 AM. The primary change within `CutiePie` was correcting the logic to find the minimum index where a number can be made divisible by 25 by checking combinations of 0, 2, 5, and 7,  and correctly outputting the result. The initial versions had logic errors in determining and outputting the `ans` variable.  The final version added `<<endl;` to properly format the output.


**File: `B_Bad_Boy.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:17:40 AM - 9:18:31 AM)**

This file tracked the implementation of the `CutiePie` function for a different problem. The edits show a progressive implementation, starting with an empty `cout` statement and incrementally adding output values (1, 1, a, b) based on input variables a, b, c, and d. The complete code was achieved within 1 minute, between 9:17:40 AM and 9:18:31 AM.


**File: `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` (6/11/2025, 9:32:13 AM - 9:47:33 AM)**

This file represents the most extensive development effort, spanning approximately 15 minutes. The `CutiePie` function's evolution is substantial:

* Initial versions contained incomplete function definitions.
* Input reading and vector creation were implemented step by step.
*  Significant changes involved reversing the input vector and then iteratively calculating and printing a sum based on medians. There were many iterations involving correcting the logic for calculating the sum of medians, adjusting loop conditions, and handling edge cases.  Incorrect indexing and loop termination were addressed over several commits. The final version correctly computes the sum of medians and prints the output.

In summary, the code log demonstrates the iterative development of three distinct C++ programs, all using a consistent code structure but with evolving function implementations.  The `B_Sum_of_Medians.cpp` file shows the most complex and iterative development process.
