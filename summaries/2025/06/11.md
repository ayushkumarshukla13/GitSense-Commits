# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 6:46:38 AM
The log shows modifications to `C_Cool_Partition.cpp` between 12:55:20 AM and 12:56:34 AM on June 11, 2025.  The file contains a C++ program.  The core changes center around the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was empty.  At 12:55:46 AM, it was updated to count the number of divisors of an input integer *n*.  At 12:55:56 AM, the code was improved to print the count of divisors.  A final modification at 12:56:34 AM introduced a seemingly erroneous `else{ break; }` statement within the divisor counting loop, causing the function to potentially terminate prematurely and incorrectly for some input values.  The rest of the code (commented-out sieve, power, factorial, modular inverse, and nCr functions) remained unchanged throughout the log.  The main function consistently reads an integer `qt` (always 1 in the given log) and calls `CutiePie()` `qt` times.


## 8:49:33 AM
The log shows development of two C++ files: `B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` and `B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp`.

`B_Odd_Grasshopper.cpp` underwent extensive modification between 8:17 AM and 8:35 AM.  The core change involved developing a function `CutiePie` that processes input integers (`n` and `x`). The logic within `CutiePie`  focuses on handling even and odd numbers, specifically using modulo operations (`%`) and conditional statements to determine and output a result based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 and 4.  Several intermediate commits show incremental progress towards a complete solution, with many edits focusing on correcting conditional logic and output statements.  The final version (8:35 AM) presents a complete solution to a problem that likely involves determining a final value based on the parity of input integers.

`B_Make_it_Divisible_by_25.cpp` was worked on between 8:37 AM and 8:43 AM. This file aims to solve a problem where an integer needs to be made divisible by 25.  The code extracts digits from the input integer (`n`) and then attempts to find combinations of digits that, when forming a two-digit number, are divisible by 25 (i.e., containing either 00, 25, 50, or 75). The final version (8:43 AM) uses nested loops to check for the presence of 0 or 5 in various positions and potentially uses those to determine a final value. The comments in both files suggest that the developer initially planned to implement several other algorithms (Sieve of Eratosthenes, calculating divisors, etc.) but ultimately did not use them in the final solution.
