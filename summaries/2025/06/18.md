# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 1:12:37 PM
The log shows two updates to the `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Stock\zerodha-clone\backend\.env` file.  The first entry at 12:13:36 PM on June 18, 2025, shows an empty `MONGO_URL` environment variable. The second entry, just 13 seconds later at 12:13:49 PM on the same day, updates `MONGO_URL` with a MongoDB connection string, indicating the addition of a MongoDB database connection to the application.  The pattern observed is the modification of the `MONGO_URL` variable to establish a database connection.


## 5:42:12 PM
The log shows the evolution of the `C_Quests.cpp` file over a period of approximately 20 minutes on June 18, 2025.  The initial code contained commented-out sections for sieve, calculating divisors, and various mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr).  These were not modified during the session.

The main focus of the changes was on the `CutiePie()` function. Initially, this function was empty.  Subsequent updates involved:

* **3:51:24 PM:**  Input variables `n` and `k` were added, along with the beginning of a vector declaration.
* **3:51:35 PM:**  The vector `v` was fully declared and started to be populated with input.
* **3:51:52 PM:** A vector `p` was added and began being populated with input.
* **3:52:07 PM:**  Vector `p` was fully populated with input.
* **3:54:47 PM - 3:56:30 PM:**  The core logic of `CutiePie()` was implemented.  This involved calculating a running sum (`ans`) based on the maximum of elements in `v` and a running maximum from `p`.  There were several iterations to refine this logic, particularly concerning the handling of the `maxi` variable and the loop conditions.  The final version includes a conditional check (`if(v[i]>=maxi)`) and outputs the final `ans`.
* **3:57:56 PM - 4:00:15 PM:**  The loop in `CutiePie()` was modified to handle circular indexing (`i%n`), adapting the algorithm to work correctly with a potentially repeating pattern of values. The code was also cleaned.
* **4:00:15 PM - 4:04:59 PM:** The vectors `v` and `p` were changed from size `n` to `n+1`. This caused significant changes in code, requiring adjustments in indexing and input handling. The loop limit in the final algorithm was also changed from `n` to `k`. 
* **4:04:59 PM - 4:17:45 PM:**  The logic was further refined.  The code was significantly cleaned, addressing array bounds. The `ans` variable was correctly initialized and error handling for the `k==1` case was added.
* **4:18:49 PM:** minor cleanup and formatting.
* **4:21:18 PM:** minor cleanup and formatting.
* **4:23:27 PM:** minor cleanup and formatting.
* **4:25:28 PM - 4:52:19 PM:** Further refinements were made to the algorithm's logic for the case when `k` exceeds `n`, ensuring correct handling of array indices. The `maxi` variable was improved, now correctly handling cases where `k>n`.  Multiple minor cleanups and formatting occurred.
* **5:31:21 PM - 5:35:13 PM:**  The function was completely rewritten. The algorithm appears to now calculate a maximum sum of a subarray possibly bounded by `k`. The implementation uses vectors instead of arrays and is more concise.

Throughout the log, there is a recurring theme of refining the algorithm's handling of edge cases (e.g., `k` being 1 or larger than `n`) and improving its efficiency and clarity.  The final version of the code is a substantially more efficient and cleaner solution.


## 7:41:57 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program, `B_Collecting_Game.cpp`, between 7:40 PM and 7:41 PM on June 18, 2025.  The primary changes focus on the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was a stub.  Subsequent commits added input reading of an integer `n` and the creation of a vector `v` to store `n` integers read from standard input. There's commented-out code for sieve of Eratosthenes, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr which are not used in the final version.

Between 7:40:49 PM and 7:41:07 PM, the code for reading `n` integers into vector `v` was completed.

Between 7:41:07 PM and 7:41:24 PM, a `pre` vector was initialized, suggesting an intention to calculate prefix sums.  The implementation of prefix sum calculation was incomplete at this stage.

Finally, by 7:41:46 PM, the `CutiePie` function was completed. A  `pre` vector is created and populated with the prefix sums of the input vector `v`.  An additional vector `a` is also declared but not used, possibly leftover from earlier experimentation.  The commented-out code remains throughout the entire process, suggesting it might be intended for future use or was part of an earlier version of the algorithm.


## 8:42:00 PM
The log shows development of two C++ files: `B_Collecting_Game.cpp` and `C_Yarik_and_Array.cpp`.

`B_Collecting_Game.cpp` underwent significant changes between 7:42 PM and 7:47 PM on June 18, 2025.  The core logic involves reading an array, sorting it, calculating prefix sums, and then processing it to populate a map `m` which seems to store indices based on a condition involving prefix sums and sorted array elements. The final version outputs the values from the map corresponding to the original input array.  Many commented-out code sections are present, including functions for calculating factorials, powers, modular inverses, and combinations, and sieve of Eratosthenes code for finding prime numbers,  suggesting initial exploration of different approaches before settling on the final solution.


`C_Yarik_and_Array.cpp`, modified between 8:21 PM and 8:38 PM on June 18, 2025, focuses on finding the maximum sum of a subarray under certain conditions. The code iterates through the input array, accumulating a sum.  If the sum becomes negative or consecutive elements have the same parity (even or odd), the sum is reset to 0. The maximum sum encountered is stored in `ans` and printed at the end.  The final version uses `abs(v[i])%2` for parity checking, making the solution more robust.  The initial versions had incomplete or incorrect logic, demonstrating the iterative refinement process.  Similar commented-out code sections as in `B_Collecting_Game.cpp` are present.
