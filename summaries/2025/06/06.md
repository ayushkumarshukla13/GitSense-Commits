# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 7:28:21 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp` and `C_Raspberries.cpp`.  `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp` underwent significant changes between 6:37 AM and 6:56 AM, primarily focused on refining a function called `CutiePie`. This function takes a string as input, counts the occurrences of '0' and '1', and performs operations based on these counts.  The initial versions were incomplete, with `CutiePie` evolving from a simple `st` declaration to a more complex algorithm involving conditional statements and calculations based on the counts of '0' and '1'. The final version of `CutiePie` outputs a single integer based on these counts.  The commented-out code suggests the file originally included functions for sieve of Eratosthenes, calculating divisors and combinations; however, none of these were used in the final version.

`C_Raspberries.cpp` was worked on between 7:10 AM and 7:27 AM. The file takes integers `n` and `k` as input along with a vector `v` of size `n`. The code then focuses on implementing logic for specific values of `k`, namely `k=2` and `k=3`. For k=2 it checks if any element in v is even, if so outputs 0 otherwise 1. For `k=3`, it calculates a value `ans` based on the elements of `v` modulo 3 and determines an output based on whether `ans` is divisible by 3 or if there is a number in `v` congruent to 2 modulo 3. The code suggests an attempt to extend this logic for `k=5`, but this part remains incomplete.  Like `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp`, it also contains commented-out code related to sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculations, which were not used in the implemented logic.


## 8:28:17 AM
The log shows the evolution of the `C_Raspberries.cpp` file between 7:29 AM and 7:34 AM on June 6th, 2025.  The code implements a function `CutiePie` that solves a problem based on the input integer `k`.  The logic changes over time, focusing on improving the handling of different `k` values (2, 3, and 5).

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve and calculating divisors. These were not modified during the observed period. The core changes are in the `CutiePie` function:


* **k == 2:** The initial implementation correctly identifies whether at least one even number exists in the input vector `v`.  A later revision (around 7:32 AM) simplifies the code by directly returning 0 if an even number is found, instead of setting a boolean flag.


* **k == 3:** This case undergoes several revisions.  The original approach calculates a product modulo 3 and uses an additional variable `qt` (initially INT_MAX, later irrelevant).  It checks if the product is divisible by 3.  Subsequent edits refine the condition for printing 1 or 2 based on whether a number with a remainder of 2 is found. An unnecessary variable `qt` is removed, and the logic is simplified to directly return 0 if `ans%3==0`.


* **k == 5:**  The logic for k==5 is iteratively improved. The original version has an error where `ans` is declared twice. It's fixed by changing the second declaration to `qt` (initially INT_MAX, then INT_MIN), tracking the maximum remainder when dividing by 5.  The final version (after 7:31 AM) correctly computes the output value (5 - max_remainder). The `ans` variable appears to be unused here and is redundant. Additionally, the code is simplified to directly return 0 when a number divisible by 5 is found.


* **`else` block:**  The final change at 7:34 AM adds an empty `else` block after the k==5 case, suggesting an attempt to handle other `k` values in future revisions.


Throughout the changes, the commented-out sections remained unchanged, indicating a focus on refining the core solution logic rather than expanding the functionalities.  The most significant changes are concentrated between 7:30 AM and 7:33 AM, focusing on correcting errors and simplifying the conditions within the `CutiePie` function for k=3 and k=5.  The use of modulo operations is consistent across all `k` cases, suggesting a consistent algorithmic approach.


## 9:28:25 AM
The log shows a single file, `C_Raspberries.cpp`, undergoing numerous modifications between 8:28 AM and 9:02 AM, and another file `A_Helmets_in_Night_Light.cpp` undergoing modifications between 9:18 AM and 9:28 AM.

**C_Raspberries.cpp:** The file `C_Raspberries.cpp` appears to contain a solution to a coding problem.  The initial code (8:28 AM) includes commented-out code for sieve and divisor calculation functions, suggesting initial exploration of different approaches. The `CutiePie` function handles cases for k = 2, 3, and 5, with a general case for other values of k.  The primary changes across the revisions involve refining the logic within the `else` block of the `CutiePie` function, primarily focusing on handling modulo operations and adding conditional statements to return 0, 1, or 2 based on specific conditions related to the modulo operation results and the existence of certain modulo values in the input vector `v`. The final version improves the efficiency of the modulo operations within the loops.  The changes are incremental, suggesting a debugging process.  A key modification occurred around 8:31 AM, where a boolean variable `c` was introduced for better condition tracking within the general `else` case.  Further modifications refined the conditional logic around 8:35 AM (introducing `d`) and then improved efficiency of modulo operations at 8:48 AM and 8:58 AM.  The final adjustments to the code occurred at around 9:00 AM, mostly focusing on fixing the logic within the k=5 and general cases to address edge conditions and ensure accurate output.

**A_Helmets_in_Night_Light.cpp:** This file, started at 9:18 AM,  initially seems to be another coding problem solution.  The code structure is similar to `C_Raspberries.cpp` â€“  using a `CutiePie` function and commented-out code snippets for mathematical functions.  The changes focus on building a `map` called `mp` to store a mapping between two input vectors `a` and `b`. The edits between 9:18 and 9:20 AM demonstrate the incremental construction of the `map`.  Around 9:20 AM,  the code starts to build logic for iterating through this map (`it=mp.begin()`) and incorporating the map's values into a variable called `ans`. Further changes from 9:21 AM to 9:23 AM show attempts to refine the logic of the iteration based on the map's values and the `n` variable, and to improve output at the end of function. Between 9:23 AM and 9:28 AM, the code was finalized with improved iteration logic and conditions, resulting in the final version at 9:28 AM.  The final code implements a solution that iteratively adds values based on conditions involving the map's contents.


In both files, a significant amount of commented-out code for common mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr) is present. This might suggest that the developer initially considered using these functions but later opted for a more direct approach within the specific problem solutions. The consistent use of the `CutiePie` function name across both files might indicate a personal naming convention.


## 10:28:20 AM
The log shows edits to two C++ files, `A_Helmets_in_Night_Light.cpp` and `B_Monsters.cpp`, along with several intermediate edits to `B_Olya_and_Game_with_Arrays.cpp`.

**`A_Helmets_in_Night_Light.cpp`**:  This file underwent two edits on June 6th, 2025, between 9:31:05 AM and 9:32:15 AM. The key change was in the `CutiePie` function, specifically how the `multimap mp` is populated. Initially, it used `mp[b[i]]=a[i];`, which overwrote values with the same key. The corrected version uses `mp.insert({b[i],a[i]});`, ensuring that all pairs are stored.


**`B_Olya_and_Game_with_Arrays.cpp`**:  This file shows a series of edits between 9:49:49 AM and 9:58:16 AM on June 6th, 2025, reflecting the iterative development of the solution. The changes involve progressively building the `CutiePie` function.  The main steps include:

1. Initialization of a 2D vector `v`.
2. Reading input for nested vectors.
3. Sorting the inner vectors.
4. Calculating a sum based on second minimum elements of sorted inner vectors.
5. Refining the calculation by considering minimum element.
6. Finalizing code to output the calculated sum.


**`B_Monsters.cpp`**: This file was edited several times between 10:03:33 AM and 10:15:06 AM on June 6th, 2025. The edits focus on implementing the `CutiePie` function to solve the "Monsters" problem.  The function takes input `n` and `k`, processes an array `a` by taking the modulo with `k`, then uses a `multimap` to store and output the indices based on the remainders.  The code was iteratively refined, with debugging outputs and a final version producing the desired index output.  The final version appears complete at 10:15:06 AM.

A common element across all three files is the inclusion of commented-out code blocks for sieve methods (prime number generation) and calculating divisors. These suggest the programmer might have initially considered using these algorithms but ultimately used different approaches.  The frequent use of `multimap` shows that the programmer relied on this data structure in their solutions.


## 11:28:13 AM
The file `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\B_Monsters.cpp` underwent two edits on June 6th, 2025.  The first edit at 10:39:00 AM and the second at 10:39:15 AM.  The changes were minor.  The commented-out code remained unchanged. The primary difference between the two versions lies within the `CutiePie()` function.  Specifically, a conditional statement `if()` was removed from the first `for` loop inside the `CutiePie()` function between the two revisions.  No other substantial changes to functionality were observed. The code appears to solve a problem involving modular arithmetic and sorting based on remainders.  The use of `multimap` suggests the need for preserving order while handling potential duplicate values.


## 2:28:15 PM
The log shows iterative development of the `CutiePie` function within the `B_Monsters.cpp` file.  The primary focus of the changes is the handling of input array `a` and the integer `k`.

Between 2:13 PM and 2:15 PM, the core logic of `CutiePie` changed significantly. Initially, the code processed the array by using a `multimap` to store and output elements. Later versions introduced a pre-processing step where if an element `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, it's set to 0 and its index is printed.  A subsequent refinement at 2:14:08 PM added a check to skip already processed elements (those set to 0) in the `multimap` insertion.  The changes between 2:15:00 PM and 2:15:30 PM are negligible, only involving minor code formatting.


The most substantial change occurred between 2:15 PM and 2:17 PM. The condition `if(a[i]<=k)` was replaced with `if(a[i]==k)`, altering the logic for zeroing out array elements.


Finally, between 2:21 PM and 2:22 PM the code underwent further modification where an attempt was made to handle the case where k is zero, however this attempt (`if(k==0){}`) does nothing.  The condition within the loop for setting elements to zero also changed several times, progressing from `a[i]<=k`, to `a[i]==k`, and finally settling on `a[i]%k==0`.  This demonstrates a debugging process aimed at correctly identifying and handling elements divisible by `k`. The final version at 2:22:46 PM uses the modulo operator `%` for this condition, which is the most correct and efficient way to achieve the desired logic.

Throughout the log, commented-out code for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modInverse, and nCr functions is consistently present but never actively used.  This suggests the programmer initially considered using these functions but ultimately decided against their inclusion in the final implementation of `CutiePie`.


## 3:28:17 PM
The log shows development on two C++ files: `B_Monsters.cpp` and `C_Ski_Resort.cpp`.

`B_Monsters.cpp` underwent several revisions between 2:43:40 PM and 2:44:45 PM on June 6, 2025.  The core change involved refining the logic for processing an array (`a`) based on a given value (`k`). Initially, elements divisible by `k` were set to 0 and their indices printed; subsequently, the code was modified to utilize `multimap` to store and print indices based on the remainder after dividing by `k`. A temporary `multimap` called `ek` was added and later removed.  The final version uses a single `multimap` (`mp`) and cleanly separates the output for elements divisible by `k` from those with non-zero remainders.


`C_Ski_Resort.cpp` saw more substantial changes between 2:57:35 PM and 3:03:48 PM on June 6, 2025. The file initially contained a largely empty `CutiePie` function.  The evolution involved:

1. **2:57:41 PM and 2:57:47 PM:** Uncommenting and implementing the `modInverse` and `nCr` functions (combinations).
2. **2:58:00 PM:** Implementing the `power` function.
3. **2:58:14 PM - 2:59:54 PM:** Incremental development of the `CutiePie` function.  This involved adding input variables (`n`, `k`, `t`), a vector `v` to store input values, and a loop to count elements (`ct`) less than or equal to `t`.
4. **3:00:02 PM - 3:00:14 PM:** The code was further refined to include a check for `ct` being greater than or equal to `k`, and to use the `nCr` function to calculate combinations.
5. **3:00:37 PM - 3:03:48 PM:**  The final version of `CutiePie` correctly calculates and prints the number of combinations (`ans`) of at least `k` consecutive elements less than or equal to `t`. The counter `ct` is reset to 0 whenever an element greater than `t` is encountered.  The final output is the total number of combinations.

A common pattern across both files is the inclusion of commented-out code blocks related to sieves, divisor calculations, and other mathematical functions. These are likely helper functions that were explored or are intended for future use, but were not ultimately necessary for the implemented solutions.
