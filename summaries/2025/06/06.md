# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 7:28:21 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp` and `C_Raspberries.cpp`.  `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp` underwent significant changes between 6:37 AM and 6:56 AM, primarily focused on refining a function called `CutiePie`. This function takes a string as input, counts the occurrences of '0' and '1', and performs operations based on these counts.  The initial versions were incomplete, with `CutiePie` evolving from a simple `st` declaration to a more complex algorithm involving conditional statements and calculations based on the counts of '0' and '1'. The final version of `CutiePie` outputs a single integer based on these counts.  The commented-out code suggests the file originally included functions for sieve of Eratosthenes, calculating divisors and combinations; however, none of these were used in the final version.

`C_Raspberries.cpp` was worked on between 7:10 AM and 7:27 AM. The file takes integers `n` and `k` as input along with a vector `v` of size `n`. The code then focuses on implementing logic for specific values of `k`, namely `k=2` and `k=3`. For k=2 it checks if any element in v is even, if so outputs 0 otherwise 1. For `k=3`, it calculates a value `ans` based on the elements of `v` modulo 3 and determines an output based on whether `ans` is divisible by 3 or if there is a number in `v` congruent to 2 modulo 3. The code suggests an attempt to extend this logic for `k=5`, but this part remains incomplete.  Like `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp`, it also contains commented-out code related to sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculations, which were not used in the implemented logic.


## 8:28:17 AM
The log shows the evolution of the `C_Raspberries.cpp` file between 7:29 AM and 7:34 AM on June 6th, 2025.  The code implements a function `CutiePie` that solves a problem based on the input integer `k`.  The logic changes over time, focusing on improving the handling of different `k` values (2, 3, and 5).

Initially, the code contained commented-out sections for sieve and calculating divisors. These were not modified during the observed period. The core changes are in the `CutiePie` function:


* **k == 2:** The initial implementation correctly identifies whether at least one even number exists in the input vector `v`.  A later revision (around 7:32 AM) simplifies the code by directly returning 0 if an even number is found, instead of setting a boolean flag.


* **k == 3:** This case undergoes several revisions.  The original approach calculates a product modulo 3 and uses an additional variable `qt` (initially INT_MAX, later irrelevant).  It checks if the product is divisible by 3.  Subsequent edits refine the condition for printing 1 or 2 based on whether a number with a remainder of 2 is found. An unnecessary variable `qt` is removed, and the logic is simplified to directly return 0 if `ans%3==0`.


* **k == 5:**  The logic for k==5 is iteratively improved. The original version has an error where `ans` is declared twice. It's fixed by changing the second declaration to `qt` (initially INT_MAX, then INT_MIN), tracking the maximum remainder when dividing by 5.  The final version (after 7:31 AM) correctly computes the output value (5 - max_remainder). The `ans` variable appears to be unused here and is redundant. Additionally, the code is simplified to directly return 0 when a number divisible by 5 is found.


* **`else` block:**  The final change at 7:34 AM adds an empty `else` block after the k==5 case, suggesting an attempt to handle other `k` values in future revisions.


Throughout the changes, the commented-out sections remained unchanged, indicating a focus on refining the core solution logic rather than expanding the functionalities.  The most significant changes are concentrated between 7:30 AM and 7:33 AM, focusing on correcting errors and simplifying the conditions within the `CutiePie` function for k=3 and k=5.  The use of modulo operations is consistent across all `k` cases, suggesting a consistent algorithmic approach.
