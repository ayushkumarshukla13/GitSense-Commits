# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 7:28:21 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp` and `C_Raspberries.cpp`.  `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp` underwent significant changes between 6:37 AM and 6:56 AM, primarily focused on refining a function called `CutiePie`. This function takes a string as input, counts the occurrences of '0' and '1', and performs operations based on these counts.  The initial versions were incomplete, with `CutiePie` evolving from a simple `st` declaration to a more complex algorithm involving conditional statements and calculations based on the counts of '0' and '1'. The final version of `CutiePie` outputs a single integer based on these counts.  The commented-out code suggests the file originally included functions for sieve of Eratosthenes, calculating divisors and combinations; however, none of these were used in the final version.

`C_Raspberries.cpp` was worked on between 7:10 AM and 7:27 AM. The file takes integers `n` and `k` as input along with a vector `v` of size `n`. The code then focuses on implementing logic for specific values of `k`, namely `k=2` and `k=3`. For k=2 it checks if any element in v is even, if so outputs 0 otherwise 1. For `k=3`, it calculates a value `ans` based on the elements of `v` modulo 3 and determines an output based on whether `ans` is divisible by 3 or if there is a number in `v` congruent to 2 modulo 3. The code suggests an attempt to extend this logic for `k=5`, but this part remains incomplete.  Like `B_Swap_and_Delete.cpp`, it also contains commented-out code related to sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor calculations, which were not used in the implemented logic.
