# Activity Summary for 6/17/2025

## 12:05:45 PM
The log shows edits to two C++ files: `C_Move_Brackets.cpp` and `A_Johnny_and_Ancient_Computer.cpp`.  `C_Move_Brackets.cpp` underwent extensive modification between 11:05 AM and 11:13 AM, focusing on a `CutiePie` function that processes a string to count unbalanced parentheses.  Initially, the function was empty. It then evolved to read input (string `s`), and then calculate the counts of opening and closing brackets (`ct1` and `ct2`).  The logic for handling bracket matching was refined incrementally over several edits. Finally, the code calculates and outputs the total number of unbalanced brackets divided by 2 at 11:13:34 AM, indicating the solution to the problem. At 11:16:13 AM the function was reset to an empty function, indicating a possible reset or attempt at a different solution.

`A_Johnny_and_Ancient_Computer.cpp` was modified between 11:16 AM and 11:27 AM. The `CutiePie` function in this file aims to solve a problem involving reducing two numbers (`a` and `b`) by repeatedly dividing by 2 until they are equal, or determining if it's impossible. The initial attempts were incomplete. The code's evolution involved adding conditions to check for even numbers and incrementing counters (`c` and `d`).  Significant progress is seen around 11:20 AM where the condition `if(a!=b)` is introduced to handle impossible cases. The final version (11:27:25 AM) efficiently handles both even and odd number scenarios and calculates the number of steps required to make the numbers equal.  The code also includes error handling for cases where the numbers cannot be made equal.

Both files share a common structure:  They include numerous commented-out code segments relating to sieve methods, divisor calculations, and mathematical functions (factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr). These commented sections were present consistently throughout all versions of both files indicating they were likely added once at the beginning of coding the files.  This suggests the programmer may have initially explored various approaches before focusing on the specific problem solutions.
