# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 12:42:20 AM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program, `C_Yet_Another_Card_Deck.cpp`, between 11:42 PM and 12:33 AM on June 29th and 30th, 2025.  The initial code contains commented-out code for sieve methods and divisor calculations, suggesting exploration of different algorithmic approaches.  The main focus of the edits is on the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` is empty.  Over several edits (11:42:35 PM - 11:43:05 PM), the function is fleshed out to read two integers, `n` and `q`, and a vector `v` of size `n`.  Input is then read into vector `v`.

Subsequent changes (11:43:31 PM - 11:45:08 PM) involve creating another vector `vq` of size `q`, and incorporating a map `m` to store elements of `v` and their initial positions.  The code attempts to track the position of elements in `v` as they are encountered, but the implementation has errors in accessing the map. These errors are corrected between 11:45:08 PM and 11:47:19 PM.  A vector `ans` is introduced to store the results.

Between 11:47:19 PM and 11:47:53 PM, the `ans` vector is populated with the positions of elements from `vq` in the map. This phase also attempts to increment the values in the map during the loop, creating an additional error.

The next edits (11:49:22 PM - 12:11:39 PM) show refinements and corrections, focusing on using iterators and improving code clarity. A `vector<pair<int,int>> vp` is introduced as an alternative data structure to store the card values and positions. This change makes the logic much more efficient and likely aims to improve performance.  The final working version of `CutiePie()` uses a `map` to store values and their positions and iterates over the query vector to get the position of each element.

The final, working code (from 12:31:36 AM onwards) efficiently solves the problem statement with clean, concise code.  The commented-out sections remain throughout the entire process. The final code efficiently determines the position of elements from a query vector within an input vector using a map. The `for` loop in `main` function is eventually set to execute only once.

The overall pattern shows a progression from an initial incomplete function to a refined and efficient solution, reflecting a common debugging and optimization process.  The timestamps show a concentrated period of development around 11:42 PM to 12:17 AM, with a final refinement around 12:30 AM.
