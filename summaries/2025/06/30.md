# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 12:42:20 AM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program, `C_Yet_Another_Card_Deck.cpp`, between 11:42 PM and 12:33 AM on June 29th and 30th, 2025.  The initial code contains commented-out code for sieve methods and divisor calculations, suggesting exploration of different algorithmic approaches.  The main focus of the edits is on the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` is empty.  Over several edits (11:42:35 PM - 11:43:05 PM), the function is fleshed out to read two integers, `n` and `q`, and a vector `v` of size `n`.  Input is then read into vector `v`.

Subsequent changes (11:43:31 PM - 11:45:08 PM) involve creating another vector `vq` of size `q`, and incorporating a map `m` to store elements of `v` and their initial positions.  The code attempts to track the position of elements in `v` as they are encountered, but the implementation has errors in accessing the map. These errors are corrected between 11:45:08 PM and 11:47:19 PM.  A vector `ans` is introduced to store the results.

Between 11:47:19 PM and 11:47:53 PM, the `ans` vector is populated with the positions of elements from `vq` in the map. This phase also attempts to increment the values in the map during the loop, creating an additional error.

The next edits (11:49:22 PM - 12:11:39 PM) show refinements and corrections, focusing on using iterators and improving code clarity. A `vector<pair<int,int>> vp` is introduced as an alternative data structure to store the card values and positions. This change makes the logic much more efficient and likely aims to improve performance.  The final working version of `CutiePie()` uses a `map` to store values and their positions and iterates over the query vector to get the position of each element.

The final, working code (from 12:31:36 AM onwards) efficiently solves the problem statement with clean, concise code.  The commented-out sections remain throughout the entire process. The final code efficiently determines the position of elements from a query vector within an input vector using a map. The `for` loop in `main` function is eventually set to execute only once.

The overall pattern shows a progression from an initial incomplete function to a refined and efficient solution, reflecting a common debugging and optimization process.  The timestamps show a concentrated period of development around 11:42 PM to 12:17 AM, with a final refinement around 12:30 AM.


## 11:57:08 AM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `B_Kalindrome_Array.cpp` and `C_Paint_the_Array.cpp`, and a partial development of `D_Three_Activities.cpp`.  The changes span a period from 10:57 AM to 11:41 AM on June 30, 2025.

**B_Kalindrome_Array.cpp:** This file underwent significant revisions between 10:57 AM and 11:06 AM.  Initially, the `CutiePie` function was empty.  Subsequent changes involved:

* Reading input into a vector `v`.
* Implementing a two-pointer approach (`i` and `j`) to compare elements from the beginning and end of the vector.
* Identifying potentially non-palindromic pairs (`a` and `b`).
* Creating two new vectors, `c1` and `c2`, containing elements excluding `a` and `b` respectively.
* Checking if `c1` and `c2` are palindromes.
* Finally, outputting "YES" if either `c1` or `c2` is a palindrome, and "NO" otherwise.  A special case is handled for vectors of length 1, outputting "YES".


**C_Paint_the_Array.cpp:** This file was developed between 11:17 AM and 11:41 AM. The `CutiePie` function's evolution focused on:

* Reading input into a vector `v`.
* Calculating the greatest common divisors (`a` and `b`) of elements at even and odd indices respectively.
* Checking whether elements at even indices are divisible by `b` and elements at odd indices are divisible by `a`.
* Outputting `a` or `b` as the result based on divisibility checks; 0 is outputted if neither condition is met.  The final version successfully implements this logic.


**D_Three_Activities.cpp:** This file shows an incomplete implementation.  The code starts by initializing three vectors (`a`, `b`, `c`) to store activities and their indices as pairs. The vectors are sorted and reversed.  The final changes attempt to compute the maximum sum of activities, ensuring that the indices are different for each selected activity from each vector, but the implementation remains incomplete at the end of the log.


**Recurring Patterns:**  All three files contain commented-out code blocks related to sieve algorithms and divisor calculations.  This suggests the programmer might have initially explored different approaches before focusing on the core logic of each problem. The `#define int long long` line is also consistently present across all three files, indicating a common need for handling large integers.
