# Activity Summary for 6/22/2025

## 7:32:29 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`B_Li_Hua_and_Pattern.cpp`) over a period of approximately 30 minutes on June 22, 2025.  The initial version contains commented-out code for sieve and divisor calculations, along with commented-out functions for factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr calculations. The `CutiePie` function is initially very basic, taking two integer inputs `n` and `k` without any further processing.

Subsequent changes focus on developing the `CutiePie` function to process a square matrix of size n x n.  This involved:

1. **6/22/2025, 6:41:39 PM:**  A `vector<vector<int>> v` is introduced to store the matrix. Input reading within the nested loops is incomplete.

2. **6/22/2025, 6:41:50 PM - 6:42:17 PM:**  The code progressively refines the input reading for the matrix, using a nested loop and `temp` vector to store each row before pushing it into the `v` vector.

3. **6/22/2025, 6:42:53 PM - 6:43:55 PM:** A `vector<int> qt` is introduced to store all elements of the matrix linearly. A `while` loop compares elements from both ends of `qt` (`i` and `j` pointers) and counts the number of discrepancies (`ct`).  The output is changed to print the count `ct`.

4. **6/22/2025, 6:44:14 PM - 6:44:21 PM:** The program now includes conditional logic, checking if `ct` is less than or equal to `k`, and printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

5. **6/22/2025, 6:45:11 PM:** Added a condition `if(n%2)` to adjust `k` if `n` is odd. This suggests the algorithm is handling odd and even sized matrices differently.

6. **6/22/2025, 6:46:54 PM:** The `qt` vector is renamed to `z` for clarity.

7. **6/22/2025, 6:48:32 PM:** The `while` loop condition is changed from `<` to `<=`, likely to account for the middle element when n is odd.

8. **6/22/2025, 6:51:26 PM - 6:54:29 PM:** The code adds conditional logic based on `n%2`.  An attempt is made to handle the input and processing of the matrix differently for even and odd `n`.  The code is still incomplete at this stage.

9. **6/22/2025, 6:54:38 PM - 7:31:18 PM:** The code undergoes significant changes, many of which appear to be incomplete or experimental.  The `CutiePie` function is being significantly restructured, likely to implement the logic to handle the comparison of matrix elements, but multiple edits suggest that the developer is experimenting with different approaches. The final version appears incomplete.


The commented-out code suggests the developer initially considered using prime number sieving and divisor counting, which were ultimately not incorporated into the final (incomplete) version. The majority of the changes revolve around correctly handling the input and processing of the nxn matrix, specifically to account for odd and even values of n. The last changes indicate that the developer is still actively working on the core logic for handling the matrix in the CutiePie function.


## 8:32:25 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ files: `B_Li_Hua_and_Pattern.cpp` and `B_GCD_Partition.cpp`.

**B_Li_Hua_and_Pattern.cpp:** This file underwent extensive modification between 7:36 PM and 8:06 PM.  The core logic involves reading a square matrix, potentially processing it differently based on whether its dimensions are even or odd, and then performing a comparison of elements from opposite ends of a resulting vector (`b`). This comparison uses two pointers (`i` and `j`), moving inwards from both ends, and counting discrepancies (`ct`). The final output ("YES" or "NO") depends on whether the count of discrepancies is less than or equal to a threshold (`k`).  The initial version contained commented-out code for sieve of Eratosthenes, calculation of divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr, which were not used in the final implementation.  The code was refined iteratively, with multiple attempts to correctly handle the even and odd matrix cases and the final comparison logic.  The handling of the case where `n` is 1 was added later, and there was some trial-and-error involved in the final `ct` calculation and comparison.


**B_GCD_Partition.cpp:** This file's development spanned a shorter period, from 8:17 PM to 8:21 PM.  The code reads a vector of integers (`v`), calculates a prefix sum vector (`pre`), and then iterates to find the maximum greatest common divisor (`gcd`) between the prefix sums up to index `i` and the difference between the total prefix sum and the prefix sum up to `i`. The final `gcd` is then printed. The initial version was incomplete, and the crucial `__gcd` function from `<numeric>` was introduced, followed by the implementation of the logic for computing the maximum GCD.  The logic for handling `gc` was improved slightly with an extra `max` operation.


## 9:32:20 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`E_Negatives_and_Positives.cpp`) between 8:45 PM and 8:46 PM on June 22, 2025.  The file contains a `CutiePie` function that processes an input array of integers.


The initial versions of `CutiePie`  simply read in the input without performing any calculations.

Between 8:45:20 PM and 8:45:26 PM, the code was updated to count the number of negative integers in the input.

A further modification at 8:45:46 PM added the calculation of the sum of absolute values of input integers.  At 8:45:52 PM, an attempt was made to find the minimum absolute value, but the code was incomplete.

By 8:46:00 PM, the code included a conditional statement (`if(a%2)P`) which appears to be incomplete logic based on whether the count of negative numbers (`a`) is odd or even.


Finally, at 8:46:07 PM and 8:46:20 PM, the `CutiePie` function was completed. The final version calculates the sum of absolute values (`b`) and the minimum absolute value (`mini`) of the input integers.  It then outputs `b - 2*mini` if the number of negative integers is odd, and `b` otherwise. This suggests the program aims to solve a problem related to minimizing the sum of integers by potentially changing the sign of some. The commented-out code at the beginning suggests exploration of other algorithms (sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, nCr) that were not ultimately used in the final version.
