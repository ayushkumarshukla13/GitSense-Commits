# Activity Summary for 6/22/2025

## 7:32:29 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`B_Li_Hua_and_Pattern.cpp`) over a period of approximately 30 minutes on June 22, 2025.  The initial version contains commented-out code for sieve and divisor calculations, along with commented-out functions for factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr calculations. The `CutiePie` function is initially very basic, taking two integer inputs `n` and `k` without any further processing.

Subsequent changes focus on developing the `CutiePie` function to process a square matrix of size n x n.  This involved:

1. **6/22/2025, 6:41:39 PM:**  A `vector<vector<int>> v` is introduced to store the matrix. Input reading within the nested loops is incomplete.

2. **6/22/2025, 6:41:50 PM - 6:42:17 PM:**  The code progressively refines the input reading for the matrix, using a nested loop and `temp` vector to store each row before pushing it into the `v` vector.

3. **6/22/2025, 6:42:53 PM - 6:43:55 PM:** A `vector<int> qt` is introduced to store all elements of the matrix linearly. A `while` loop compares elements from both ends of `qt` (`i` and `j` pointers) and counts the number of discrepancies (`ct`).  The output is changed to print the count `ct`.

4. **6/22/2025, 6:44:14 PM - 6:44:21 PM:** The program now includes conditional logic, checking if `ct` is less than or equal to `k`, and printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

5. **6/22/2025, 6:45:11 PM:** Added a condition `if(n%2)` to adjust `k` if `n` is odd. This suggests the algorithm is handling odd and even sized matrices differently.

6. **6/22/2025, 6:46:54 PM:** The `qt` vector is renamed to `z` for clarity.

7. **6/22/2025, 6:48:32 PM:** The `while` loop condition is changed from `<` to `<=`, likely to account for the middle element when n is odd.

8. **6/22/2025, 6:51:26 PM - 6:54:29 PM:** The code adds conditional logic based on `n%2`.  An attempt is made to handle the input and processing of the matrix differently for even and odd `n`.  The code is still incomplete at this stage.

9. **6/22/2025, 6:54:38 PM - 7:31:18 PM:** The code undergoes significant changes, many of which appear to be incomplete or experimental.  The `CutiePie` function is being significantly restructured, likely to implement the logic to handle the comparison of matrix elements, but multiple edits suggest that the developer is experimenting with different approaches. The final version appears incomplete.


The commented-out code suggests the developer initially considered using prime number sieving and divisor counting, which were ultimately not incorporated into the final (incomplete) version. The majority of the changes revolve around correctly handling the input and processing of the nxn matrix, specifically to account for odd and even values of n. The last changes indicate that the developer is still actively working on the core logic for handling the matrix in the CutiePie function.
