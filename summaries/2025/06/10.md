# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 5:19:50 PM
The log shows multiple updates to a `.env` file between 5:04 PM and 5:12 PM on June 10, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `DB_CONNECT_STRING` environment variable.  Initially, the connection string was incomplete and seemingly incorrect.  It was then updated several times, changing the username and possibly the database name (IIITL_Codes appears briefly).  The final update reverts to a state similar to the second update, where a database name is missing.  The `PORT` variable remained consistently set to `3000` throughout all changes.
