# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 5:19:50 PM
The log shows multiple updates to a `.env` file between 5:04 PM and 5:12 PM on June 10, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `DB_CONNECT_STRING` environment variable.  Initially, the connection string was incomplete and seemingly incorrect.  It was then updated several times, changing the username and possibly the database name (IIITL_Codes appears briefly).  The final update reverts to a state similar to the second update, where a database name is missing.  The `PORT` variable remained consistently set to `3000` throughout all changes.


## 6:19:53 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a coding project, primarily focused on user authentication.  Significant changes occurred between 5:42 PM and 5:45 PM on June 10, 2025.

`package.json` and `package-lock.json` were updated at approximately 5:42 PM.  These updates reflect the addition of several dependencies to the project, including `bcrypt`, `cookie-parser`, `dotenv`, `express`, `jsonwebtoken`, `mongoose`, and `validator`, indicating the setup of a backend application using Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction), and other relevant packages.  The `package-lock.json` file details the specific versions and dependencies of each package, ensuring reproducibility.


`src\controllers\userAuthent.js` (in both Day01 and Day02 folders) contains the core authentication logic. This file remained largely unchanged between its two appearances (Day01 and Day02 versions are identical), implementing user registration and login functionalities using bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for token generation.  The `logout` function is included but currently empty.


`src\routes\userAuth.js` (in both Day01 and Day02 folders) defines the API routes for user authentication, also remaining virtually unchanged between its two appearances.  It defines POST routes for `/register` and `login`, and a POST route for `logout`, and a GET route for `getProfile` (the implementation of `getProfile` is not present in this log).


`src\utils\validator.js` (in both Day01 and Day02 folders)  contains a validation function that checks for mandatory fields (`firstName`, `emailId`, `password`), email validity, and password strength using the `validator` library.  This file also remained consistent in both Day01 and Day02 versions.

There is a pattern of near-identical code across files between a `Day01` and `Day02` folder, suggesting either a copy operation or a refactoring that hasn't been fully completed by the time the log was captured.  The only observable difference between the Day 01 and Day 02 folders was the timestamp.
