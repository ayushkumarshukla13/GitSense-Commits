# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 5:19:50 PM
The log shows multiple updates to a `.env` file between 5:04 PM and 5:12 PM on June 10, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `DB_CONNECT_STRING` environment variable.  Initially, the connection string was incomplete and seemingly incorrect.  It was then updated several times, changing the username and possibly the database name (IIITL_Codes appears briefly).  The final update reverts to a state similar to the second update, where a database name is missing.  The `PORT` variable remained consistently set to `3000` throughout all changes.


## 6:19:53 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a coding project, primarily focused on user authentication.  Significant changes occurred between 5:42 PM and 5:45 PM on June 10, 2025.

`package.json` and `package-lock.json` were updated at approximately 5:42 PM.  These updates reflect the addition of several dependencies to the project, including `bcrypt`, `cookie-parser`, `dotenv`, `express`, `jsonwebtoken`, `mongoose`, and `validator`, indicating the setup of a backend application using Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction), and other relevant packages.  The `package-lock.json` file details the specific versions and dependencies of each package, ensuring reproducibility.


`src\controllers\userAuthent.js` (in both Day01 and Day02 folders) contains the core authentication logic. This file remained largely unchanged between its two appearances (Day01 and Day02 versions are identical), implementing user registration and login functionalities using bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for token generation.  The `logout` function is included but currently empty.


`src\routes\userAuth.js` (in both Day01 and Day02 folders) defines the API routes for user authentication, also remaining virtually unchanged between its two appearances.  It defines POST routes for `/register` and `login`, and a POST route for `logout`, and a GET route for `getProfile` (the implementation of `getProfile` is not present in this log).


`src\utils\validator.js` (in both Day01 and Day02 folders)  contains a validation function that checks for mandatory fields (`firstName`, `emailId`, `password`), email validity, and password strength using the `validator` library.  This file also remained consistent in both Day01 and Day02 versions.

There is a pattern of near-identical code across files between a `Day01` and `Day02` folder, suggesting either a copy operation or a refactoring that hasn't been fully completed by the time the log was captured.  The only observable difference between the Day 01 and Day 02 folders was the timestamp.


## 7:19:51 PM
The log shows modifications to a `user.js` file across two days (Day01 and Day02).  The primary changes involve the `user` model schema within the `user.js` file.

On Day01 (6/10/2025, 6:34:02 PM), an initial `user` schema was defined using Mongoose, including fields for `firstName`, `lastName`, `emailId`, `age`, `role`, and `problemSolved`.

A subsequent update on Day01 (6/10/2025, 6:34:33 PM) added a crucial `password` field to the `user` schema, indicating a likely enhancement for user authentication.  This is a significant change.  There were no changes to the `user.js` file on Day02.  The file structure suggests a project organized by day, with models located in `src/models`.


## 11:32:01 PM
The codebase underwent significant changes between 10:36 PM and 10:41 PM on June 10, 2025.  The `.gitignore` file was updated to include standard exclusions for Node modules, environment files, logs, build outputs, and editor/OS files.

The `db.js` file shows a simple connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, relying on an environment variable for the connection string.  The `redis.js` file establishes a connection to a Redis server, also using environment variables for credentials and connection details.

The `userAuthent.js` controller handles user registration and login, using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication. A crucial addition is logout functionality which utilizes Redis to block tokens for added security.  The controller also includes separate registration endpoints for users and admins.

The `adminMiddleware.js` and `userMiddleware.js` files implement middleware for verifying user and admin tokens respectively. Both middleware functions check for token presence, validity, and blocklisted status in Redis before granting access.  The `adminMiddleware.js` additionally checks the user's role.

The `user.js` model defines the schema for users, including fields for personal information, roles, solved problems, and passwords.  The `problem.js` model defines the schema for coding problems, detailing various problem aspects.

The `problemCreator.js` router sets up routes for creating, updating, deleting, fetching, and retrieving problems.  The `userAuth.js` router manages user authentication, including registration, login, logout, and admin registration, incorporating the authentication middleware.

The `validator.js` file includes functions for input validation, ensuring mandatory fields are present and data formats are correct. The `index.js` file is the main application file, initializing the database connection, Redis connection, and setting up the Express server.  The server listens on a port defined in the `.env` file.

Finally, the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files specify project dependencies, reflecting the libraries used in the application (including bcrypt, express, mongoose, redis, and jsonwebtoken).  The dependencies are consistent between both files.  The overall pattern demonstrates a well-structured Node.js application with user authentication, database interaction, and caching mechanisms.
