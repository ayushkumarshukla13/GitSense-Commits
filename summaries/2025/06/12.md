# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 9:20:17 AM
The log shows edits to `problemUtility.js` on June 12th, 2025, between 12:34 AM and 12:36 AM.  The file contains functions `getLanguageById` (mapping programming language names to IDs) and `submitBatch` (which uses the Judge0 API to submit code batches for judging).  The `getLanguageById` function remained unchanged throughout the log.

The `submitBatch` function underwent changes in its `x-rapidapi-key` header within the `options` object.  Initially, the key was `ab99c6ec42mshfd636ec7c6687efp1b9043jsna684835b0591`. This key was then updated to `096038f454msh8c15578a4cfe8c9p114ba6jsn9edc7f1b10e2` at approximately 12:36 AM, remaining unchanged afterwards.  The rest of the `submitBatch` function remained consistent.  The changes suggest an API key update occurred during this period.


## 10:13:12 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`Min_Max_Deletion.cpp`) over a short period.  Initially, the file was empty.  The code then underwent significant development, focusing on a `CutiePie` function. This function first takes input `n`, reads `n` integers into a vector `v`, and counts their occurrences using a map `m`.  If any integer appears only once, the function outputs -1 and returns. Otherwise, it proceeds to manipulate the input vector.

Between 9:14 AM and 9:17 AM, the core logic of `CutiePie` was developed, involving the use of a map to count frequencies, handling the case where an element occurs only once, and initiating a two-pointer approach (`l` and `r`) to iterate through the vector.  The commented-out code suggests initially explored functionalities like sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculations, and other mathematical functions, but these were ultimately unused.

Between 9:17 AM and 9:18 AM, the code implemented a rotation operation (`rotate`) using iterators on the vector `v` based on the two-pointer logic.

Around 9:18 AM to 9:21 AM,  the code changed from operating directly on `v` to operating on a separate `ans` vector, which was initialized to store indices 0 to n-1.  The rotation was then applied to this `ans` vector.  Finally, the `ans` vector (representing indices) is printed.


Around 9:21 AM to 9:24 AM, minor adjustments to the rotation logic and output were made.  

At 9:41 AM a significant change occurred; the entire CutiePie function was replaced with a new implementation. The program now takes an additional input `k` and a string `s` of length `n`.  

From 9:41 AM to 9:47 AM, the  new `CutiePie` function calculated a prefix sum array (`pre`) based on whether each character of `s` was 'W' or not. It then finds the minimum sub-array sum of a window of size k which represents finding the minimum number of 'W' within a sliding window of size k.  

Finally,  at 10:00 AM, the program was refactored. The previous logic was largely abandoned. The `CutiePie` function was rewritten to calculate the number of times `n` can be divided by 2, and later used a `binpow` function (binary exponentiation) to compute 2 to the power of that count.  The final version prints 0 and the result of this exponentiation.  This represents a complete change of problem being solved from the initial logic.


The timestamps indicate a rapid iterative development process, with several significant changes in the algorithm and the problem being solved occurring within a relatively short period.  A recurring theme is the use of standard library functions like `vector`, `map`, and `rotate`, indicative of a standard C++ programming approach.  The commented-out code sections suggest an initial exploration of a broader range of algorithms before settling on the final implementation(s).


## 11:13:10 AM
The file `Min_Max_Deletion.cpp` underwent significant changes between 10:17 AM and 11:12 AM on June 12, 2025.  The initial versions contained commented-out code for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions. These were largely untouched throughout the edits.

The core changes focused on the `CutiePie` function. Initially, it only declared an integer `n`. Subsequent changes involved:

* **10:17:45 AM:** Added a variable `m` initialized to `n`.
* **10:18:08 AM:** Introduced a counter `ct` and a `while` loop to repeatedly divide `m` by 2 until `m` is less than or equal to 1, incrementing `ct` each time.
* **10:18:35 AM:** A `binpow` function (binary exponentiation) was added to compute 2 raised to the power of `ct`.
* **10:18:55 AM:**  The `MOD` macro was changed to `mod`.
* **10:19:01 AM:** No discernible changes.
* **10:19:29 AM - 10:20:05 AM:** The `binpow` function is called within `CutiePie` to calculate `qt`.  The result is printed to the console.
* **10:20:20 AM - 10:21:22 AM:**  The `CutiePie` function was modified to print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `qt-1`, then 0, then `qt`, then numbers from `qt+1` to `n-1`.  A conditional statement ensures a different output if `qt` equals `n`.
* **10:21:41 AM:** The for loop in `CutiePie` starts from 1 instead of 0.
* **10:22:31 AM:** The upper bound of the last for loop in `CutiePie` is adjusted to `n` instead of `n-1`.
* **10:22:56 AM - 10:24:23 AM:** A `vector<int> v` was introduced to store the sequence of numbers, and the loop iterates to populate it. The final output of `CutiePie` became the bitwise XOR sum of all elements in `v`.
* **10:24:53 AM:** The code is cleaned up. `v` is not used.
* **11:09:19 AM - 11:12:48 AM:**  The `CutiePie` function was completely refactored.  Its functionality now involves reading two integers `x` and `y` and then processing `k` more integers read from standard input using a nested loop. A `vector` `v` is declared but not fully utilized.  The purpose of this section is unclear without further context.


The commented-out code suggests the program was initially intended to perform various mathematical operations (sieve, divisors, combinations), but the final version primarily focuses on a specific sequence generation and bitwise XOR operation, the purpose of which is not fully clear from the log alone.  The later modifications to `CutiePie` drastically change its purpose, introducing input reading beyond the initial `n`.


## 12:13:06 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`Min_Max_Deletion.cpp`) over a short period on June 12, 2025.  Initially, the code contained a `CutiePie` function that calculated the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of two input vectors.  Between 11:13 AM and 11:14 AM, this function was modified to handle two sets of input vectors, calculating a maximum difference for each set and storing them in variables `a` and `b`.  The final calculation using `a` and `b` was incomplete in these initial revisions.

Subsequent edits (11:14 AM - 11:14:51 AM) completed the calculation within `CutiePie`, culminating in a final calculation `ans = max(c, d);`  where `c` and `d` are derived from `a` and `b`. There was also a small change in the output of the result to include `endl`.


Between 11:35 AM and 11:49 AM, the code underwent a significant restructuring. The `CutiePie` function was completely rewritten to take a single integer `n` as input, read `n` integers into a vector `v`, sort the vector, and then construct another vector `ans` based on a pattern involving alternating positive and negative integers, dependent on the value of `n`. This pattern was refined incrementally over several commits. Finally, the code calculates a sum of elements in the `ans` vector, which seems to be the final intended output.   The original input vector `v` is also outputted in reverse order.  The commented-out sections throughout the file, which appear to contain commented-out sieve, and calculating divisor functions remain unchanged across all commits.  The frequent commits in this period suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the algorithm.


## 1:13:08 PM
The file `Min_Max_Deletion.cpp` underwent significant revisions between 12:29 PM and 1:10 PM on June 12, 2025.  The initial versions (12:29 PM and 12:29:40 PM) implemented a solution to a problem involving finding a sum based on an input vector, using sorting and a specific pattern of positive and negative integers.  A `return;` statement was added at 12:29:40 PM to handle a specific case (n=3, v={1,2,3}).

Between 12:30 PM and 12:35 PM, the code was substantially rewritten. The approach shifted to using a `vector<pair<int,int>>` to store both the input values and their original indices.  This allowed the algorithm to  process the vector, calculating a total and storing results in an `ans` vector while preserving the original indices.  During this period, there were several incomplete code versions with syntax errors, suggesting incremental development and debugging.

A complete and seemingly functional version using the `pair` approach appeared around 12:34:08 PM. This version involves sorting the pairs, reversing them, iterating to calculate a `total`, and creating an `ans` vector reflecting the transformations.


From 12:38 PM onwards, the code was repeatedly modified, primarily within the `CutiePie` function. These changes involved removing the earlier logic and introducing a new algorithm focused on the XOR operation (`^`). The commented-out sections suggest the removal of the original solution approach. This new section uses XOR to solve another problem entirely; given integers `a` and `b`,  it determines and prints an integer related to `a` and the XOR sum up to `a-1`. The final version at 1:10:38 PM correctly handles cases where the XOR sum matches `b` or can be made to match `b` by adding 1 or 2 to `a`.  The commented-out code sections show various intermediate steps of refinement and debugging in the final algorithm.  The initial problem (input vector manipulation) was completely replaced.


## 8:56:24 PM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ code file, `A_Equal_Subsequences.cpp`, over a short period on June 12th, 2025.  The primary changes center around the `CutiePie` function.

Initially, the `CutiePie` function was incomplete, with a `for` loop in the process of being written.  Between 8:06:50 PM and 8:07:09 PM, the loop was expanded to include `ans.push`, which was then corrected to `ans.push_back(0)` at 8:07:09 PM.  This suggests the programmer was building a string.  Finally, by 8:07:35 PM, the function was completed. It now takes two integer inputs (a and b), creates a string `ans` containing '1' repeated 'b' times followed by '0' repeated 'a-b' times, and then prints the string.  The final version of the code (8:07:41 PM) is identical to the one at 8:07:35 PM, indicating no further changes were made.

The commented-out code sections at the beginning of the file suggest the initial intention might have included functionalities like a sieve of Eratosthenes (for prime number generation), calculation of divisors, factorial, power, and modular inverse functions. These were ultimately not used in the final version of the code, which focuses solely on the string manipulation within `CutiePie`.  The timestamps show rapid iterative development of the `CutiePie` function.
