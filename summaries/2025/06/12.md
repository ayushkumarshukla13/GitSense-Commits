# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 9:20:17 AM
The log shows edits to `problemUtility.js` on June 12th, 2025, between 12:34 AM and 12:36 AM.  The file contains functions `getLanguageById` (mapping programming language names to IDs) and `submitBatch` (which uses the Judge0 API to submit code batches for judging).  The `getLanguageById` function remained unchanged throughout the log.

The `submitBatch` function underwent changes in its `x-rapidapi-key` header within the `options` object.  Initially, the key was `ab99c6ec42mshfd636ec7c6687efp1b9043jsna684835b0591`. This key was then updated to `096038f454msh8c15578a4cfe8c9p114ba6jsn9edc7f1b10e2` at approximately 12:36 AM, remaining unchanged afterwards.  The rest of the `submitBatch` function remained consistent.  The changes suggest an API key update occurred during this period.


## 10:13:12 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`Min_Max_Deletion.cpp`) over a short period.  Initially, the file was empty.  The code then underwent significant development, focusing on a `CutiePie` function. This function first takes input `n`, reads `n` integers into a vector `v`, and counts their occurrences using a map `m`.  If any integer appears only once, the function outputs -1 and returns. Otherwise, it proceeds to manipulate the input vector.

Between 9:14 AM and 9:17 AM, the core logic of `CutiePie` was developed, involving the use of a map to count frequencies, handling the case where an element occurs only once, and initiating a two-pointer approach (`l` and `r`) to iterate through the vector.  The commented-out code suggests initially explored functionalities like sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculations, and other mathematical functions, but these were ultimately unused.

Between 9:17 AM and 9:18 AM, the code implemented a rotation operation (`rotate`) using iterators on the vector `v` based on the two-pointer logic.

Around 9:18 AM to 9:21 AM,  the code changed from operating directly on `v` to operating on a separate `ans` vector, which was initialized to store indices 0 to n-1.  The rotation was then applied to this `ans` vector.  Finally, the `ans` vector (representing indices) is printed.


Around 9:21 AM to 9:24 AM, minor adjustments to the rotation logic and output were made.  

At 9:41 AM a significant change occurred; the entire CutiePie function was replaced with a new implementation. The program now takes an additional input `k` and a string `s` of length `n`.  

From 9:41 AM to 9:47 AM, the  new `CutiePie` function calculated a prefix sum array (`pre`) based on whether each character of `s` was 'W' or not. It then finds the minimum sub-array sum of a window of size k which represents finding the minimum number of 'W' within a sliding window of size k.  

Finally,  at 10:00 AM, the program was refactored. The previous logic was largely abandoned. The `CutiePie` function was rewritten to calculate the number of times `n` can be divided by 2, and later used a `binpow` function (binary exponentiation) to compute 2 to the power of that count.  The final version prints 0 and the result of this exponentiation.  This represents a complete change of problem being solved from the initial logic.


The timestamps indicate a rapid iterative development process, with several significant changes in the algorithm and the problem being solved occurring within a relatively short period.  A recurring theme is the use of standard library functions like `vector`, `map`, and `rotate`, indicative of a standard C++ programming approach.  The commented-out code sections suggest an initial exploration of a broader range of algorithms before settling on the final implementation(s).


## 11:13:10 AM
The file `Min_Max_Deletion.cpp` underwent significant changes between 10:17 AM and 11:12 AM on June 12, 2025.  The initial versions contained commented-out code for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, modular inverse, and nCr functions. These were largely untouched throughout the edits.

The core changes focused on the `CutiePie` function. Initially, it only declared an integer `n`. Subsequent changes involved:

* **10:17:45 AM:** Added a variable `m` initialized to `n`.
* **10:18:08 AM:** Introduced a counter `ct` and a `while` loop to repeatedly divide `m` by 2 until `m` is less than or equal to 1, incrementing `ct` each time.
* **10:18:35 AM:** A `binpow` function (binary exponentiation) was added to compute 2 raised to the power of `ct`.
* **10:18:55 AM:**  The `MOD` macro was changed to `mod`.
* **10:19:01 AM:** No discernible changes.
* **10:19:29 AM - 10:20:05 AM:** The `binpow` function is called within `CutiePie` to calculate `qt`.  The result is printed to the console.
* **10:20:20 AM - 10:21:22 AM:**  The `CutiePie` function was modified to print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `qt-1`, then 0, then `qt`, then numbers from `qt+1` to `n-1`.  A conditional statement ensures a different output if `qt` equals `n`.
* **10:21:41 AM:** The for loop in `CutiePie` starts from 1 instead of 0.
* **10:22:31 AM:** The upper bound of the last for loop in `CutiePie` is adjusted to `n` instead of `n-1`.
* **10:22:56 AM - 10:24:23 AM:** A `vector<int> v` was introduced to store the sequence of numbers, and the loop iterates to populate it. The final output of `CutiePie` became the bitwise XOR sum of all elements in `v`.
* **10:24:53 AM:** The code is cleaned up. `v` is not used.
* **11:09:19 AM - 11:12:48 AM:**  The `CutiePie` function was completely refactored.  Its functionality now involves reading two integers `x` and `y` and then processing `k` more integers read from standard input using a nested loop. A `vector` `v` is declared but not fully utilized.  The purpose of this section is unclear without further context.


The commented-out code suggests the program was initially intended to perform various mathematical operations (sieve, divisors, combinations), but the final version primarily focuses on a specific sequence generation and bitwise XOR operation, the purpose of which is not fully clear from the log alone.  The later modifications to `CutiePie` drastically change its purpose, introducing input reading beyond the initial `n`.
