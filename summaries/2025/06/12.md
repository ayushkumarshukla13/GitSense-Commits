# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 9:20:17 AM
The log shows edits to `problemUtility.js` on June 12th, 2025, between 12:34 AM and 12:36 AM.  The file contains functions `getLanguageById` (mapping programming language names to IDs) and `submitBatch` (which uses the Judge0 API to submit code batches for judging).  The `getLanguageById` function remained unchanged throughout the log.

The `submitBatch` function underwent changes in its `x-rapidapi-key` header within the `options` object.  Initially, the key was `ab99c6ec42mshfd636ec7c6687efp1b9043jsna684835b0591`. This key was then updated to `096038f454msh8c15578a4cfe8c9p114ba6jsn9edc7f1b10e2` at approximately 12:36 AM, remaining unchanged afterwards.  The rest of the `submitBatch` function remained consistent.  The changes suggest an API key update occurred during this period.


## 10:13:12 AM
The log shows the evolution of a C++ program (`Min_Max_Deletion.cpp`) over a short period.  Initially, the file was empty.  The code then underwent significant development, focusing on a `CutiePie` function. This function first takes input `n`, reads `n` integers into a vector `v`, and counts their occurrences using a map `m`.  If any integer appears only once, the function outputs -1 and returns. Otherwise, it proceeds to manipulate the input vector.

Between 9:14 AM and 9:17 AM, the core logic of `CutiePie` was developed, involving the use of a map to count frequencies, handling the case where an element occurs only once, and initiating a two-pointer approach (`l` and `r`) to iterate through the vector.  The commented-out code suggests initially explored functionalities like sieve of Eratosthenes, divisor calculations, and other mathematical functions, but these were ultimately unused.

Between 9:17 AM and 9:18 AM, the code implemented a rotation operation (`rotate`) using iterators on the vector `v` based on the two-pointer logic.

Around 9:18 AM to 9:21 AM,  the code changed from operating directly on `v` to operating on a separate `ans` vector, which was initialized to store indices 0 to n-1.  The rotation was then applied to this `ans` vector.  Finally, the `ans` vector (representing indices) is printed.


Around 9:21 AM to 9:24 AM, minor adjustments to the rotation logic and output were made.  

At 9:41 AM a significant change occurred; the entire CutiePie function was replaced with a new implementation. The program now takes an additional input `k` and a string `s` of length `n`.  

From 9:41 AM to 9:47 AM, the  new `CutiePie` function calculated a prefix sum array (`pre`) based on whether each character of `s` was 'W' or not. It then finds the minimum sub-array sum of a window of size k which represents finding the minimum number of 'W' within a sliding window of size k.  

Finally,  at 10:00 AM, the program was refactored. The previous logic was largely abandoned. The `CutiePie` function was rewritten to calculate the number of times `n` can be divided by 2, and later used a `binpow` function (binary exponentiation) to compute 2 to the power of that count.  The final version prints 0 and the result of this exponentiation.  This represents a complete change of problem being solved from the initial logic.


The timestamps indicate a rapid iterative development process, with several significant changes in the algorithm and the problem being solved occurring within a relatively short period.  A recurring theme is the use of standard library functions like `vector`, `map`, and `rotate`, indicative of a standard C++ programming approach.  The commented-out code sections suggest an initial exploration of a broader range of algorithms before settling on the final implementation(s).
