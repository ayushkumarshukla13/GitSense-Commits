# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 9:20:17 AM
The log shows edits to `problemUtility.js` on June 12th, 2025, between 12:34 AM and 12:36 AM.  The file contains functions `getLanguageById` (mapping programming language names to IDs) and `submitBatch` (which uses the Judge0 API to submit code batches for judging).  The `getLanguageById` function remained unchanged throughout the log.

The `submitBatch` function underwent changes in its `x-rapidapi-key` header within the `options` object.  Initially, the key was `ab99c6ec42mshfd636ec7c6687efp1b9043jsna684835b0591`. This key was then updated to `096038f454msh8c15578a4cfe8c9p114ba6jsn9edc7f1b10e2` at approximately 12:36 AM, remaining unchanged afterwards.  The rest of the `submitBatch` function remained consistent.  The changes suggest an API key update occurred during this period.
