# Activity Summary for 6/7/2025

## 10:40:54 AM
The log shows the development of a C++ program (`B_Basketball_Together.cpp`) over a short period on June 7th, 2025.  The program appears to solve a problem involving an array (`v`) of integers,  `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the size of array and `k` may be some target value.  Initially, the code included commented-out sections suggesting potential uses of sieves, divisor calculations, and modular arithmetic functions.  These were never used in the final version.

Between 10:26 AM and 10:27 AM, the main changes involved completing the input section for `v` and sorting it.  Further refinements between 10:27 AM and 10:32 AM focused on developing the core logic of `CutiePie()`. This involved using two pointers (`i` and `j`) to iterate from the beginning and end of the sorted array `v` respectively, and a counter variable `count` (later `ans`). The algorithm appears to be based on some form of two-pointer approach that depends upon the values of `k` and elements of the sorted `v` vector.

Several incomplete attempts at the core algorithm's `while` loop condition and  incrementations of `i` and `ans` were made within this period. The final correct version of the algorithm was achieved around 10:32 AM, where the `while` loop correctly iterates, updating `i` and `ans` based on a condition that checks if `i` is less than `j`.

Subsequent modifications after 10:32 AM involved removing debugging print statements (e.g., printing array `v`), which were initially included to help track variable values in the code. The commented out debugging print statements are visible in later logs. Finally, the `main` function's loop that processes multiple test cases was changed from using `cin >> qt;` to just `int qt=1;` thereby hardcoding the test case to 1.

The overall development pattern indicates an iterative approach to algorithm design, with the programmer refining the core logic of the `CutiePie()` function through incremental changes and debugging steps.


## 11:40:52 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `B_Basketball_Together.cpp` file between 10:41 AM and 10:48 AM on June 7th, 2025, focusing on refining a function called `CutiePie`.  The initial version of `CutiePie` contained a `while` loop with a logic error in the termination condition and the calculation of `qt`. Subsequent commits progressively corrected this loop's condition and  the `qt` calculation, adding additional checks (`j>=0`, `i<n`) to ensure the loop iterates correctly.  Specifically, the `if(k%v[j]==0) qt--;` line was added and later removed. The final change involved initializing variable `i` to -1 instead of 0.  The commented-out code blocks related to sieve, caldiv, factorial, power, modInverse, and nCr remained unchanged throughout the entire process, suggesting these functionalities were not part of this specific development iteration.  A new file, `B_Beautiful_Array.cpp`, was added at 10:52 AM, containing a very basic structure similar to  `B_Basketball_Together.cpp`, but with an empty `CutiePie` function.


## 12:40:53 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program (`B_Beautiful_Array.cpp`) between 11:49 AM and 11:56 AM on June 7th, 2025.  The core functionality involves reading four integer inputs (n, k, b, s) and constructing an array based on these inputs, subject to certain constraints.

Initially, the `CutiePie()` function was empty.  Over several commits, the function was progressively fleshed out to include input reading and calculations to determine `min` and `max` values based on the inputs.  There was significant work on refining the logic to handle cases where the input `s` fell outside the allowed range (`min` to `max`), resulting in outputting "-1".

A `vector<int> ans` was introduced to store the array's elements.  The algorithm for populating this vector evolved over multiple revisions, involving iterative subtractions from `s` and conditional logic based on comparisons with `k-1`.  The final version includes a loop that fills the rest of the vector with 0s to ensure the vector has a size of `n`.  Finally, the solution prints the array elements.

Throughout the process, commented-out code related to sieving for prime numbers and calculating divisors was consistently present, suggesting these functionalities might have been explored or considered for earlier versions but were ultimately unused in the final solution.  The commented-out code remained unchanged throughout the entire edit log.  The main changes were concentrated within the `CutiePie()` function's implementation.
