# Activity Summary for 6/7/2025

## 10:40:54 AM
The log shows the development of a C++ program (`B_Basketball_Together.cpp`) over a short period on June 7th, 2025.  The program appears to solve a problem involving an array (`v`) of integers,  `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the size of array and `k` may be some target value.  Initially, the code included commented-out sections suggesting potential uses of sieves, divisor calculations, and modular arithmetic functions.  These were never used in the final version.

Between 10:26 AM and 10:27 AM, the main changes involved completing the input section for `v` and sorting it.  Further refinements between 10:27 AM and 10:32 AM focused on developing the core logic of `CutiePie()`. This involved using two pointers (`i` and `j`) to iterate from the beginning and end of the sorted array `v` respectively, and a counter variable `count` (later `ans`). The algorithm appears to be based on some form of two-pointer approach that depends upon the values of `k` and elements of the sorted `v` vector.

Several incomplete attempts at the core algorithm's `while` loop condition and  incrementations of `i` and `ans` were made within this period. The final correct version of the algorithm was achieved around 10:32 AM, where the `while` loop correctly iterates, updating `i` and `ans` based on a condition that checks if `i` is less than `j`.

Subsequent modifications after 10:32 AM involved removing debugging print statements (e.g., printing array `v`), which were initially included to help track variable values in the code. The commented out debugging print statements are visible in later logs. Finally, the `main` function's loop that processes multiple test cases was changed from using `cin >> qt;` to just `int qt=1;` thereby hardcoding the test case to 1.

The overall development pattern indicates an iterative approach to algorithm design, with the programmer refining the core logic of the `CutiePie()` function through incremental changes and debugging steps.
