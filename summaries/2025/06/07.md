# Activity Summary for 6/7/2025

## 10:40:54 AM
The log shows the development of a C++ program (`B_Basketball_Together.cpp`) over a short period on June 7th, 2025.  The program appears to solve a problem involving an array (`v`) of integers,  `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the size of array and `k` may be some target value.  Initially, the code included commented-out sections suggesting potential uses of sieves, divisor calculations, and modular arithmetic functions.  These were never used in the final version.

Between 10:26 AM and 10:27 AM, the main changes involved completing the input section for `v` and sorting it.  Further refinements between 10:27 AM and 10:32 AM focused on developing the core logic of `CutiePie()`. This involved using two pointers (`i` and `j`) to iterate from the beginning and end of the sorted array `v` respectively, and a counter variable `count` (later `ans`). The algorithm appears to be based on some form of two-pointer approach that depends upon the values of `k` and elements of the sorted `v` vector.

Several incomplete attempts at the core algorithm's `while` loop condition and  incrementations of `i` and `ans` were made within this period. The final correct version of the algorithm was achieved around 10:32 AM, where the `while` loop correctly iterates, updating `i` and `ans` based on a condition that checks if `i` is less than `j`.

Subsequent modifications after 10:32 AM involved removing debugging print statements (e.g., printing array `v`), which were initially included to help track variable values in the code. The commented out debugging print statements are visible in later logs. Finally, the `main` function's loop that processes multiple test cases was changed from using `cin >> qt;` to just `int qt=1;` thereby hardcoding the test case to 1.

The overall development pattern indicates an iterative approach to algorithm design, with the programmer refining the core logic of the `CutiePie()` function through incremental changes and debugging steps.


## 11:40:52 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `B_Basketball_Together.cpp` file between 10:41 AM and 10:48 AM on June 7th, 2025, focusing on refining a function called `CutiePie`.  The initial version of `CutiePie` contained a `while` loop with a logic error in the termination condition and the calculation of `qt`. Subsequent commits progressively corrected this loop's condition and  the `qt` calculation, adding additional checks (`j>=0`, `i<n`) to ensure the loop iterates correctly.  Specifically, the `if(k%v[j]==0) qt--;` line was added and later removed. The final change involved initializing variable `i` to -1 instead of 0.  The commented-out code blocks related to sieve, caldiv, factorial, power, modInverse, and nCr remained unchanged throughout the entire process, suggesting these functionalities were not part of this specific development iteration.  A new file, `B_Beautiful_Array.cpp`, was added at 10:52 AM, containing a very basic structure similar to  `B_Basketball_Together.cpp`, but with an empty `CutiePie` function.


## 12:40:53 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a C++ program (`B_Beautiful_Array.cpp`) between 11:49 AM and 11:56 AM on June 7th, 2025.  The core functionality involves reading four integer inputs (n, k, b, s) and constructing an array based on these inputs, subject to certain constraints.

Initially, the `CutiePie()` function was empty.  Over several commits, the function was progressively fleshed out to include input reading and calculations to determine `min` and `max` values based on the inputs.  There was significant work on refining the logic to handle cases where the input `s` fell outside the allowed range (`min` to `max`), resulting in outputting "-1".

A `vector<int> ans` was introduced to store the array's elements.  The algorithm for populating this vector evolved over multiple revisions, involving iterative subtractions from `s` and conditional logic based on comparisons with `k-1`.  The final version includes a loop that fills the rest of the vector with 0s to ensure the vector has a size of `n`.  Finally, the solution prints the array elements.

Throughout the process, commented-out code related to sieving for prime numbers and calculating divisors was consistently present, suggesting these functionalities might have been explored or considered for earlier versions but were ultimately unused in the final solution.  The commented-out code remained unchanged throughout the entire edit log.  The main changes were concentrated within the `CutiePie()` function's implementation.


## 1:40:54 PM
The log shows the development of a C++ program, `B_Luke_is_a_Foodie.cpp`, over a period of about 25 minutes on June 7th, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, `CutiePie()` was incomplete, with only input declarations.  Over several iterations, it was progressively built:

* **1:25:43 PM:** A `vector<pair<int` was started, suggesting the intention to store pairs of integers.
* **1:26:01 PM:** The `vector` was completed as `vector<pair<int,int>>v`, and a loop was added to read input `qt`  `n` times.
* **1:26:22 PM:**  Input reading within the loop was corrected.
* **1:26:41 PM:** The input `qt` was used to populate the `v` vector with pairs (`qt-x`, `qt+x`).
* **1:27:11 PM - 1:27:46 PM:** Several incremental changes focused on initializing variables `l` and `r` and starting the logic for processing the pairs in the vector.  These changes likely involve calculating a range and tracking overlapping intervals.
* **1:28:11 PM:** The core logic was completed. The `for` loop iterates, updating the `l` (max) and `r` (min) variables, and counts instances where `l > r`, indicating non-overlapping intervals.
* **1:28:55 PM - 1:29:17 PM:** Minor corrections were made to the logic and the `cout` statement was added to print the final result (`ans`).

The commented-out code at the beginning of the file suggests that the programmer initially considered implementing sieve of Eratosthenes and divisor counting functionalities, but these were ultimately not used in the final version of the code.  The final code efficiently uses a `vector<pair<int,int>>` to solve a problem likely involving intervals or ranges. The code's structure, use of `pair`, `max` and `min` functions, and the logic suggest the algorithm is related to finding disjoint intervals.


## 3:40:53 PM
The file `c:\Users\shukl\OneDrive\Desktop\Cp_ALGO\B_Shoe_Shuffling.cpp` underwent several revisions between 2:47 PM and 2:50 PM on June 7th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was the implementation of the `CutiePie()` function.

Initially, the function was incomplete.  Between 2:47:43 PM and 2:47:51 PM, input was taken for a vector `v`.  Further edits from 2:47:51 PM to 2:48:14 PM involved creating a copy of `v` into vector `a`.  Subsequent changes (2:48:14 PM - 2:48:32 PM, 2:48:32 PM - 2:48:45 PM, 2:48:45 PM - 2:48:52 PM) refined the logic within  `CutiePie()`, adding a conditional check (`if(v[0]==v[n-1])`) and printing a sequence of numbers based on that condition.  The output was finalized by adding a newline character (`cout << endl;`) and an `else` block to handle the case where the condition is false (2:48:52 PM - 2:49:09 PM). This `else` block prints -1. Finally, at 2:50:00 PM the `CutiePie()` function was emptied.  The commented-out code suggests the presence of functions for sieve, calculating divisors, factorial, power, and modular inverse which are not used in the final version of the code.  Throughout the modifications, the `main` function remained largely unchanged, indicating the focus of the debugging was within the `CutiePie()` function.


## 6:46:16 PM
The log shows multiple edits to `database.js` within a short time frame (between 5:50 PM and 5:55 PM on June 7th, 2025).  The file consistently uses the `mongodb` driver to connect to a MongoDB database.

Initially, the database name was `myProject`.  This was changed to `CoderArmy` at 5:53:28 PM.  At 5:55:17 PM, the collection name was changed from `documents` to `user`.  There were several nearly identical commits before the database name and collection name were changed, suggesting that the developer was experimenting with different database and collection names before settling on `CoderArmy` and `user`.  The connection string to the MongoDB server remained unchanged throughout all the edits.
