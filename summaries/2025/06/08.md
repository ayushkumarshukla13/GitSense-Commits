# Activity Summary for 6/8/2025

## 8:55:49 PM
The log shows development of three C++ programs: `A_False_Alarm.cpp`, `B_Shrink.cpp`, and `C_Cool_Partition.cpp`.  All three files consistently include commented-out code blocks for sieve, calculating divisors, and several mathematical functions (factorial, power, modInverse, nCr). This suggests these functions were initially considered but later removed or unused in the final versions of the code.

`A_False_Alarm.cpp` underwent significant changes between 6/8/2025, 8:06 PM and 8:09 PM. The core logic involved reading an integer n and x and then reading n more integers to store in a vector. The code evolved from an incomplete `CutiePie` function to a fully functional one that counts the number of 1s in a vector and checks if this count is less than or equal to x. The final version efficiently determines and prints "YES" or "NO" based on this condition.

`B_Shrink.cpp` shows a simpler evolution between 8:13 PM and 8:14 PM. The initial version was incomplete, printing only "1" and attempting to iterate through a sequence. The completed version prints a sequence from 1 to n, which appears to be a straightforward task.

`C_Cool_Partition.cpp` also experienced significant changes between 8:22 PM and 8:40 PM.  The initial goal was seemingly to analyze the frequency of elements in a vector. Multiple attempts involved using `map` and `multimap` to store frequencies, but these were ultimately discarded. The final, completed version (around 8:40 PM) counts and prints the number of occurrences of the first element in the input vector.  The numerous intermediate commits reflect experimentation with different data structures and approaches to achieve this.
