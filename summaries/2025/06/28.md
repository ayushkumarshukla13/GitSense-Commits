# Activity Summary for 6/28/2025

## 2:46:44 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `G_1_Teleporters_Easy_Version.cpp` and `D_Coprime.cpp`.  Both extensively use the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header and define `int` as `long long`.  A significant number of commented-out code blocks are present in both files, suggesting a history of experimentation with different algorithms or data structures, including potential sieve methods and divisor calculations.  These commented sections remain unchanged across all timestamps.

`G_1_Teleporters_Easy_Version.cpp`: This file undergoes a series of edits between 1:46 PM and 2:07 PM.  Initially, the `CutiePie()` function is empty. The code then evolves to read input (n and c) and a vector v,  adding (i+1) to each element of v, sorting v, and finally, iteratively checking how many elements of v can be subtracted from c. The final version prints the count of such elements `ct`.

`D_Coprime.cpp`:  Development of this file spans from 2:27 PM to 2:37 PM. The `CutiePie()` function is initially incomplete. It's developed in stages: first reading input into a vector, then creating a map to store values and their indices.  Subsequent changes involve iterating through the vector and map to find pairs of coprime numbers and calculating the maximum sum of their indices plus 1. The final version handles the case where no such coprime pairs exist, outputting -1.  The core logic uses `__gcd` for greatest common divisor calculation.  A constant 1000 is used as an upper limit in the nested loop, potentially limiting the range of numbers considered for coprime checking.
