# Activity Summary for 6/28/2025

## 2:46:44 PM
The log shows the development of two C++ programs: `G_1_Teleporters_Easy_Version.cpp` and `D_Coprime.cpp`.  Both extensively use the `<bits/stdc++.h>` header and define `int` as `long long`.  A significant number of commented-out code blocks are present in both files, suggesting a history of experimentation with different algorithms or data structures, including potential sieve methods and divisor calculations.  These commented sections remain unchanged across all timestamps.

`G_1_Teleporters_Easy_Version.cpp`: This file undergoes a series of edits between 1:46 PM and 2:07 PM.  Initially, the `CutiePie()` function is empty. The code then evolves to read input (n and c) and a vector v,  adding (i+1) to each element of v, sorting v, and finally, iteratively checking how many elements of v can be subtracted from c. The final version prints the count of such elements `ct`.

`D_Coprime.cpp`:  Development of this file spans from 2:27 PM to 2:37 PM. The `CutiePie()` function is initially incomplete. It's developed in stages: first reading input into a vector, then creating a map to store values and their indices.  Subsequent changes involve iterating through the vector and map to find pairs of coprime numbers and calculating the maximum sum of their indices plus 1. The final version handles the case where no such coprime pairs exist, outputting -1.  The core logic uses `__gcd` for greatest common divisor calculation.  A constant 1000 is used as an upper limit in the nested loop, potentially limiting the range of numbers considered for coprime checking.


## 3:46:48 PM
The log shows edits to two C++ files, `D_Coprime.cpp` and `B_Kill_Demodogs.cpp`.  Both files utilize a consistent structure, including commented-out code for sieve, calculating divisors, and common mathematical functions (factorial, power, modInverse, nCr).  This suggests a common template or boilerplate is used for these programming problems.

`D_Coprime.cpp` underwent several revisions between 2:50:59 PM and 2:56:12 PM. The primary change involved correcting a logic error within the nested loops of the `CutiePie` function. Initially, the outer loop iterated incorrectly through the input vector `v`, causing a runtime error. Subsequent revisions fixed this by changing the outer loop's iterator to iterate from 1 to 1000, and added a condition `m[i]!=0` to prevent accessing elements that may not exist in the map `m`. This resulted in a more robust and accurate calculation of the maximum value (`ans`).

`B_Kill_Demodogs.cpp` was modified between 3:15:02 PM and 3:18:51 PM. The core changes focused on improving the efficiency and correctness of the formula used to calculate the result within the `CutiePie` function. Initial versions had syntax errors and lacked the modulo operation (`% MOD`) to prevent integer overflow, which was fixed in later versions. The final version shows an optimized modular arithmetic calculation to ensure the result is within the desired modulo range.  There is evidence of iterative refinement to achieve a more efficient modular arithmetic calculation within the function.  The final version explicitly uses the modulo operator (`% MOD`) throughout the calculation.
